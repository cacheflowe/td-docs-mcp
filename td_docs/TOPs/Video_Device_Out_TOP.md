## Parameters - Device Out Page
- Active `active` - Enable or disable the output card.
- Library `library` - ⊞ - Select the driver library to use.
  * Blackmagic `blackmagic` - Supports driver version 12.x
  * BlueFish444 `bluefish444` -
  * AJA `aja` -
  * Deltacast `deltacast` -

- Device `device` - ⊞ - A menu of available video devices to output to. Set the Library parameter above prior to selecting your device.
  * DeckLink 8K Pro (1) `V1` -

- Signal Format `signalformat` - The signal format to output at. This is the resolution and the frame rate, as well as if the frames are progressive or interlaced. Note that when using an interlaced format, the rate refers to fields per second.
- Output Pixel Format `outputpixelformat` - ⊞ - Set the pixel format of the output when possible (depends what type of device is used). Data may be converted to YUV colorspace depending on what the device and settings require.
  * 8-bit RGB `fixed8` - 8-bit color data, no alpha channel.
  * 8-bit + 8-bit Key (Alpha) `fixed8key8` - 8-bit color data and 8-bit alpha. This usually means SDI cables where one cable will be the color data and one cable will be the alpha data.
  * 10-bit RGB `fixed10` - 10-bit color data, no alpha.
  * 12-bit `fixed12` -

- Output Color Format `outputcolorformat` - ⊞ - Set the color format of the data sent out, for supported devices. YUV 4:2:2 or RGB 4:4:4
  * `yuv422` - YUV 4:2:2. This is the most common color format to send data over SDI wires. It requires lower bandwidth than RGB 4:4:4, but results in some information loss.
  * `rgb444` - RGB 4:4:4. This requires more bandwidth but doesn't suffer from the information loss that YUV 4:2:2 has.

- Audio CHOP `chop` - If you want to embed audio data into the output, put the path to a [Time Slice](https://docs.derivative.ca/Time_Slicing "Time Slicing") CHOP here.
- Reference Source `referencesource` - ⊞ - On AJA devices what input to use as a reference source input.
  * Default `default` -
  * External Ref In `external` -
  * SDI Input 1 `sdi1` -
  * SDI Input 2 `sdi2` -
  * SDI Input 3 `sdi3` -
  * SDI Input 4 `sdi4` -
  * SDI Input 5 `sdi5` -
  * SDI Input 6 `sdi6` -
  * SDI Input 7 `sdi7` -
  * SDI Input 8 `sdi8` -

- Audio CHOP `audiochop` - If you want to embed audio data into the output, put the path to a [Time Sliced](https://docs.derivative.ca/Time_Slicing "Time Slicing") CHOP here.
- Buffer Length `bufferlength` - The length in seconds to buffer the audio data, to avoid crackles and pops.
- Audio Bit Depth `audiobitdepth` - ⊞ - Describes the number of bits of information used for each sample.
  * 16-Bit `16bit` -
  * 32-Bit `32bit` -

- Manual Field Control `manualfield` - When outputting interlaced video if you are using a source video that is also interlaced, it's likely you'll want to make sure you are keeping the odd/even fields in sync, otherwise the video will look stuttery. You can use the 'odd_field' value in the [Info CHOP](https://docs.derivative.ca/Info_CHOP "Info CHOP") on the [Movie File In TOP](https://docs.derivative.ca/Movie_File_In_TOP "Movie File In TOP") or [Video Device In TOP](https://docs.derivative.ca/Video_Device_In_TOP "Video Device In TOP") to know if the current frame is the odd field or the even field. In general the odd field is the first frame, so you use this value in the First Field parameter to tell the Video Device Out TOP that the current frame is the first field. On the next frame you would put this value to 0 (which is also what the 'odd_frame' will go to) to tell the Video Device Out TOP that the current frame is the 2nd frame, and you now have a complete frame to output. Deinterlacing should be enabled on the Video Device In or Movie File In TOP, so that fields are fed into the network one at a time.
- First Field `firstfield` - Tells the Video Device Out TOP if the current frame being given as it's input is the First or Second field in the final output image, when outputting an interlaced video. Look at the description for Manual Field Control for more information.
- Timecode Object/CHOP/DAT `timecodeop` - Embed timecode into the output. A reference to either a CHOP with channels 'hour', 'second', 'minute', 'frame', a DAT with a timecode string in its first cell, or a [Timecode Class](https://docs.derivative.ca/Timecode_Class "Timecode Class") object.
- Transfer Mode `transfermode` - ⊞ - Controls how the image data is transfered between the GPU and the output card.
  * Automatic `automatic` - Will choose the best transfer mode for the components installed on the computer. It will choose 'Pinned' when possible, since that is the best performance.
  * Default `default` - Transfer will be done in 3 stages. GPU to CPU memory. CPU memory to driver memory. Driver memory to output card.
  * Pinned `pinned` - Transfer will be done in 2 stages. GPU to driver memory. Driver memory to output card.

- Sync Outputs `syncoutputs` - **This feature requires a Pro license.** Supported on the [Deltacast](https://docs.derivative.ca/Deltacast "Deltacast") FLEX line of cards, and [Blackmagic Design](https://docs.derivative.ca/Blackmagic_Design "Blackmagic Design") cards. Blackmagic requires a reference input to be connected. This will cause multiple independent output nodes to stay in sync with each other. Without this then each output will have it's own output queue length which may be off from the other nodes by 1 or 2 frames. Most Blackmagic cards require a Genlock source to be connected for this feature to function as well.
- Sync Group Index `syncgroupindex` - For different groups of cards, they can be ganged together into different sync groups by specifying the same index for multiple cards in the same group.
- Reset Stats `resetstats` - A pulse to reset the statistics in an attached [Info CHOP](https://docs.derivative.ca/Info_CHOP "Info CHOP").

## Parameters - Color Page

If the Working Color Space is the same Reference White, then no adjustment is done. If they are different, then the Reference White level (brightness) of the colors will be adjusted to the range expected by the Output Color Space. For example if the project is set to have a SDR Reference White of 120 nits, and the HDR Reference White is 80 nits, and the project Working Color Space is HDR while the Output Color Space is SDR: then a color of (1, 1, 1), which is 80 nits in the HDR color space, will be converted to be (0.66, 0.66, 0.66), which is 80 nits still in the SDR Output Color Space.
  * Default For Color Space `default` - Will use either the SDR or the HDR Reference White, based on the color space detected/selected.
  * Standard (SDR) `sdr` - Will treat the Output Color Space as SDR for it's reference white value.
  * High (HDR) `hdr` - Will treat the Output Color Space as HDR for it's reference white value.

## Parameters - Common Page

  * 4X `4x` - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount.
  * 8X `8x` - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount.
  * Fit Resolution `fit` - Fits the width and height to the resolution given below, while maintaining the aspect ratio.

  * Custom Resolution `custom` - Enables the Resolution parameter below, giving direct control over width and height.

- Resolution `resolution` - ⊞ - Enabled only when the Resolution parameter is set to Custom Resolution. Some Generators like Constant and Ramp do not use inputs and only use this field to determine their size. The drop down menu on the right provides some commonly used resolutions.
  * W `resolutionw` -
  * H `resolutionh` -

- Resolution Menu `resmenu` - A drop-down menu with some commonly used resolutions.
- Use Global Res Multiplier `resmult` - Uses the Global Resolution Multiplier found in **Edit >Preferences>TOPs**. This multiplies all the TOPs resolutions by the set amount. This is handy when working on computers with different hardware specifications. If a project is designed on a desktop workstation with lots of graphics memory, a user on a laptop with only 64MB VRAM can set the Global Resolution Multiplier to a value of half or quarter so it runs at an acceptable speed. By checking this checkbox on, this TOP is affected by the global multiplier.
- Output Aspect `outputaspect` - ⊞ - Sets the image aspect ratio allowing any textures to be viewed in any size. Watch for unexpected results when compositing TOPs with different aspect ratios. (You can define images with non-square pixels using xres, yres, aspectx, aspecty where xres/yres != aspectx/aspecty.)
  * Use Input `useinput` - Uses the input's aspect ratio.
  * Resolution `resolution` - Uses the aspect of the image's defined resolution (ie 512x256 would be 2:1), whereby each pixel is square.
  * Custom Aspect `custom` - Lets you explicitly define a custom aspect ratio in the Aspect parameter below.

- Aspect `aspect` - ⊞ - Use when Output Aspect parameter is set to Custom Aspect.
  * Aspect1 `aspect1` -
  * Aspect2 `aspect2` -

- Aspect Menu `armenu` - A drop-down menu with some commonly used aspect ratios.
- Input Smoothness `inputfiltertype` - ⊞ - This controls pixel filtering on the input image of the TOP.
  * Nearest Pixel `nearest` - Uses nearest pixel or accurate image representation. Images will look jaggy when viewing at any zoom level other than Native Resolution.
  * Interpolate Pixels `linear` - Uses linear filtering between pixels. This is how you get TOP images in viewers to look good at various zoom levels, especially useful when using any Fill Viewer setting other than Native Resolution.
  * Mipmap Pixels `mipmap` - Uses [ mipmap](https://docs.derivative.ca/Mipmapping "Mipmapping") filtering when scaling images. This can be used to reduce artifacts and sparkling in moving/scaling images that have lots of detail.

- Fill Viewer `fillmode` - ⊞ - Determine how the TOP image is displayed in the viewer.
**NOTE:** To get an understanding of how TOPs work with images, you will want to set this to **Native Resolution** as you lay down TOPs when starting out. This will let you see what is actually happening without any automatic viewer resizing.

  * Fit Best `best` - Stretches or squashes image so no part of image is cropped.
  * Fit Outside `outside` - Stretches or squashes image so image fills viewer while constraining it's proportions. This often leads to part of image getting cropped by viewer.
  * Native Resolution `nativeres` - Displays the native resolution of the image in the viewer.

- Viewer Smoothness `filtertype` - ⊞ - This controls pixel filtering in the viewers.
  * Nearest Pixel `nearest` - Uses nearest pixel or accurate image representation. Images will look jaggy when viewing at any zoom level other than Native Resolution.
  * Interpolate Pixels `linear` - Uses linear filtering between pixels. Use this to get TOP images in viewers to look good at various zoom levels, especially useful when using any Fill Viewer setting other than Native Resolution.

The Alpha channel in this format will always be 1. Values can go above one, but can't be negative. ie. the range is [0, infinite).
  * 16-bit float (RGB) `rgb16float` -
  * 32-bit float (RGB) `rgb32float` -

Extra Information for the Video Device Out TOP can be accessed via an [Info CHOP](https://docs.derivative.ca/Info_CHOP "Info CHOP").
###
Specific Video Device Out TOP Info Channels
  * connected - 1 if the device is connected/active, 0 if not.
