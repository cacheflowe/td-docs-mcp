# Blur TOP
## Summary

The Blur TOP blurs the image with various kernel filters and radii. It can do multi-pass blurs and can do horizontal, vertical, or z-direction blurs.
Use Pre-shrink when the blurs are high and you want to optimize performance.
**Tip:** Filter Size is expressed in pixels. If you want resolution-independent blurs, use an expression like `me.par.resolutionw/100` in the Filter Size parameter, which gives a 1% image blur.
**Note:** This TOP supports 3D Textures and 2D Texture Arrays.

## Parameters - Blur Page
- Type `type` - ⊞ - Determines the mathematical function used to create the blur.
  * Catmull-Rom `catmull` - A spline approximation to a Gaussian kernel. Gives sharper textures and more accurate edges.
  * Gaussian `gaussian` - A normal distribution where pixels at the center have more effect on the resulting pixel. Gaussian lacks sharpness but handles ringing and aliasing well.
  * Box `box` - Each pixel within the box is weighted evenly. Inexpensive and gives a "boxy" look.
  * Bartlette `bartlette` - A triangle filter. The weight of each pixel is a linear function of its distance from the center.
  * Sinc `sinc` - A sharpening filter. Some pixels contribute a negative weight to the result, artifacts may occur in the form of "ringing". Keeps small details and edges better than Gaussian.
  * Hanning `hanning` - A cosine approximation to a Gaussian kernel.
  * Blackman `blackman` - A higher order cosine approximation to a Gaussian kernel.

- Extend `extend` - ⊞ - Sets the extend conditions to determine what happens to the blur at the edge of the image.
  * Hold `hold` - The blur is clamped at the edges.
  * Repeat `repeat` - The blur is calculated as if the image was repeating (tiled - blurring at the bottom of image that would fall outside the image edges will appear at top of image).
  * Mirror `mirror` - The blur is calculated as if the image was mirrored and repeating.

- Pre-Shrink `preshrink` - Reduces the image's resolution before applying the blur. This effectively applies a 2x2 box filter on the input and creates a smaller texture to do the full blur operation on. It behaves as if the kernel size is made larger, but has less of a performance impact, but also the blur isn't as high quality vs. actually increasing the kernel size. For 3D textures, pre-shrink is applied to the slices only. There is no depth pre-shrinking.
- Filter Size `size` - The amount of blur in pixels. If you want a resolution-independent blur, use an expression like `me.par.resolutionw/100` in this parameter (which would result in a 1% image blur).
- Filter Scale `scale` - ⊞ - Scales the blur in three different axes. Each component of the Filter Scale is multiplied by the Filter Size to define the total amount of blur for each axis in pixels.
  * `scalex` -
  * `scaley` -
  * `scalez` -

- Sample Step `offset` - ⊞ - When sampling the image, this determines the distance from each pixel to the sample pixel. When units are set to pixels, it is the number of pixels away from the current pixel which is sampled to blur the image. A Sample Step of 3 would sample pixels 3 pixels away.
  * `offsetx` -
  * `offsety` -
  * `offsetz` -

- Sample Step Unit `offsetunit` - Select between Pixel, Fraction, or Fraction Aspect as the units to use for the Sample Step parameter.
- Rotate Kernel `rotate` - ⊞ - Rotates the blur filter. More noticeable when performing a horizontal blur.
  * `rotatex` -
  * `rotatey` -
  * `rotatez` -

- Dither `dither` - Enabling makes 8-bit blurs look smoother. This can help if the blur operation introduces banding or other unexpected artifacts.

## Parameters - Common Page
- Output Resolution `outputresolution` - ⊞ - quickly change the resolution of the TOP's data.
  * Use Input `useinput` - Uses the input's resolution.
  * Eighth `eighth` - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount.
  * Quarter `quarter` - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount.
  * Half `half` - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount.
  * 2X `2x` - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount.
  * 4X `4x` - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount.
  * 8X `8x` - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount.
  * Fit Resolution `fit` - Fits the width and height to the resolution given below, while maintaining the aspect ratio.
  * Limit Resolution `limit` - The width and height are limited to the resolution given below. If one of the dimensions exceeds the given resolution, the width and height will be reduced to fit inside the given limits while maintaining the aspect ratio.
  * Custom Resolution `custom` - Enables the Resolution parameter below, giving direct control over width and height.

- Resolution `resolution` - ⊞ - Enabled only when the Resolution parameter is set to Custom Resolution. Some Generators like Constant and Ramp do not use inputs and only use this field to determine their size. The drop down menu on the right provides some commonly used resolutions.
  * W `resolutionw` -
  * H `resolutionh` -

- Resolution Menu `resmenu` - A drop-down menu with some commonly used resolutions.
- Use Global Res Multiplier `resmult` - Uses the Global Resolution Multiplier found in **Edit >Preferences>TOPs**. This multiplies all the TOPs resolutions by the set amount. This is handy when working on computers with different hardware specifications. If a project is designed on a desktop workstation with lots of graphics memory, a user on a laptop with only 64MB VRAM can set the Global Resolution Multiplier to a value of half or quarter so it runs at an acceptable speed. By checking this checkbox on, this TOP is affected by the global multiplier.
- Output Aspect `outputaspect` - ⊞ - Sets the image aspect ratio allowing any textures to be viewed in any size. Watch for unexpected results when compositing TOPs with different aspect ratios. (You can define images with non-square pixels using xres, yres, aspectx, aspecty where xres/yres != aspectx/aspecty.)
  * Use Input `useinput` - Uses the input's aspect ratio.
  * Resolution `resolution` - Uses the aspect of the image's defined resolution (ie 512x256 would be 2:1), whereby each pixel is square.
  * Custom Aspect `custom` - Lets you explicitly define a custom aspect ratio in the Aspect parameter below.

- Aspect `aspect` - ⊞ - Use when Output Aspect parameter is set to Custom Aspect.
  * Aspect1 `aspect1` -
  * Aspect2 `aspect2` -

- Aspect Menu `armenu` - A drop-down menu with some commonly used aspect ratios.
- Input Smoothness `inputfiltertype` - ⊞ - This controls pixel filtering on the input image of the TOP.
  * Nearest Pixel `nearest` - Uses nearest pixel or accurate image representation. Images will look jaggy when viewing at any zoom level other than Native Resolution.
  * Interpolate Pixels `linear` - Uses linear filtering between pixels. This is how you get TOP images in viewers to look good at various zoom levels, especially useful when using any Fill Viewer setting other than Native Resolution.
  * Mipmap Pixels `mipmap` - Uses [ mipmap](https://docs.derivative.ca/Mipmapping "Mipmapping") filtering when scaling images. This can be used to reduce artifacts and sparkling in moving/scaling images that have lots of detail.

- Fill Viewer `fillmode` - ⊞ - Determine how the TOP image is displayed in the viewer.
**NOTE:** To get an understanding of how TOPs work with images, you will want to set this to **Native Resolution** as you lay down TOPs when starting out. This will let you see what is actually happening without any automatic viewer resizing.
  * Use Input `useinput` - Uses the same Fill Viewer settings as it's input.
  * Fill `fill` - Stretches the image to fit the edges of the viewer.
  * Fit Horizontal `width` - Stretches image to fit viewer horizontally.
  * Fit Vertical `height` - Stretches image to fit viewer vertically.
  * Fit Best `best` - Stretches or squashes image so no part of image is cropped.
  * Fit Outside `outside` - Stretches or squashes image so image fills viewer while constraining it's proportions. This often leads to part of image getting cropped by viewer.
  * Native Resolution `nativeres` - Displays the native resolution of the image in the viewer.

- Viewer Smoothness `filtertype` - ⊞ - This controls pixel filtering in the viewers.
  * Nearest Pixel `nearest` - Uses nearest pixel or accurate image representation. Images will look jaggy when viewing at any zoom level other than Native Resolution.
  * Interpolate Pixels `linear` - Uses linear filtering between pixels. Use this to get TOP images in viewers to look good at various zoom levels, especially useful when using any Fill Viewer setting other than Native Resolution.
  * Mipmap Pixels `mipmap` - Uses [ mipmap](https://docs.derivative.ca/Mipmapping "Mipmapping") filtering when scaling images. This can be used to reduce artifacts and sparkling in moving/scaling images that have lots of detail.

- Passes `npasses` - Duplicates the operation of the TOP the specified number of times.
