# NDI Out TOP
## Summary

The NDI Out TOP will send image and audio data over IP to other [Newtek NDI® (Network Data Interface)](https://docs.derivative.ca/NDI "NDI") enabled applications. The [NDI®](https://docs.derivative.ca/NDI "NDI") protocol is created by [Newtek](http://www.newtek.com/ndi/applications/).
See also [NDI](https://docs.derivative.ca/NDI "NDI"), [NDI In TOP](https://docs.derivative.ca/NDI_In_TOP "NDI In TOP") and [NDI DAT](https://docs.derivative.ca/NDI_DAT "NDI DAT").
**NOTE for Windows OS - If experiencing connection issues make sure Windows Firewall is disabled.**

## Parameters - NDI Out Page
- Active `active` - Makes itself available as a source and sends out image data when active.
- Source Name `name` - Specify the name for this source.
- Failover Source Name `failovername` - If this source fails while receivers are connected to it, they will instead try to connect to the specified Failover Source. This format of this should be `MACHINENAME (SourceName)`. This format is the same as you would see the source listed in the NDI In TOP.
- FPS `fps` - Specify the frame rate to send at. Note that NDI uses the FPS partially as a guide to control how to compress the frames. The higher the FPS, the more compressed the frames will be. So for example sending at 1 FPS will result in higher image quality that sending at 30 FPS.
- Low-Performance Behavior `lowperformancebehavior` - ⊞ - When the NDI sending thread isn't able to keep up due to insufficient system resources (usually available CPU time), this controls the resulting behavior of the node.
  * Stall Main Thread `stallmainthread` - The main thread will stall, giving up it's resources so the NDI sender can keep-up with the frames that are being sent. This will likely result in the main thread dropping frames.
  * Skip Frames `skipframes` - The main thread will not stall, and instead will not give the sender new frames until it has processed the ones it currently has. This can result in the NDI sender being starved of CPU time and running at a far lower FPS than the main thread.

- Output Pixel Format `outputpixelformat` - ⊞ - Controls the pixel format the output is encoded into.
  * 8-bit `fixed8` - 8-bits fixed per color channel.
  * 16-bit `fixed16` - 16-bit fixed per color channel.

- Include Alpha `includealpha` - Also sends the alpha channel when this is turned on. If this is off the alpha will be 1.0.
- Group Names Table `grouptable` - Can be DAT table with a column with the header 'groups'. Each cell listed under that heading is added as one of the NDI groups this output annouces itself as part of.
- Audio CHOP `audiochop` - Specify the [CHOP](https://docs.derivative.ca/CHOP "CHOP") (containing audio data) to send out on the NDI stream.
- Metadata DAT `metadata` - Specify the [DAT](https://docs.derivative.ca/DAT "DAT") (containing the metadata in table format **or** valid XML format) to send out on the NDI stream. The metadata can be read in by the [NDI In TOP](https://docs.derivative.ca/NDI_In_TOP "NDI In TOP") using an Info DAT.
- Output Color Space `outputcolorspace` - ⊞ - Controls what color space the data will be converted to before output. If the output (file/SDI/ST2110 etc) supports metadata, will also attempt to include the color space in that. Some output forms only support a limited number of color spaces in their metadata. If the color space is unknown to the output form, then no metadata will be included.

  * sRGB - Linear `srgblinear` - [sRGB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SRGB) color space, with linear transfer function. Considered an SDR color space with respect to Reference White.
  * Rec.601 (NTSC) `rec601ntsc` - [Rec.601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rec._601) with NTSC primaries color space, with Rec.601 transfer function. Considered an SDR color space with respect to Reference White.
  * Rec.709 `rec709` - [Rec.709](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rec._709) color space, with Rec.709 (same as Rec.2020) transfer function. Considered an SDR color space with respect to Reference White.
  * Rec.2020 `rec2020` - [Rec.2020](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rec._2020) color space, with Rec.2020 (same as Rec.709) transfer function. Considered an HDR color space with respect to Reference White.
  * Rec.2020 ST2084PQ `rec2020st2084pq` - [Rec.2020](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rec._2020) color space, with [Perceptual Quantizer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perceptual_quantizer) transfer function. Considered an HDR color space with respect to Reference White.

  * ACES2065-1 `aces2065-1` - [ACES 2065-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Color_Encoding_System) (also known as ACES AP0) color space, with a linear gamma transfer function. Considered an HDR color space with respect to Reference White.
  * ACEScg `acescg` - [ACEScg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Color_Encoding_System) (also known as ACES AP1) color space, with a linear gamma transfer function. Considered an HDR color space with respect to Reference White.
  * ACESproxy `acesproxy` - [ACESproxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Color_Encoding_System) color space, which has a log transfer function. Considered an HDR color space with respect to Reference White.
  * Passthrough `passthrough` - When selected, the color values will be used as-is in the operation, without any modification or attempt to convert them into the Working Color Space.

- Output Reference White `outputreferencewhite` - ⊞ - When converting the color values to the Working Color Space for output, this controls how they should be treated with respect to [Reference White](https://docs.derivative.ca/Color_Space#Reference_White "Color Space"). If the Working Color Space is the same Reference White, then no adjustment is done. If they are different, then the Reference White level (brightness) of the colors will be adjusted to the range expected by the Output Color Space. For example if the project is set to have a SDR Reference White of 120 nits, and the HDR Reference White is 80 nits, and the project Working Color Space is HDR while the Output Color Space is SDR: then a color of (1, 1, 1), which is 80 nits in the HDR color space, will be converted to be (0.66, 0.66, 0.66), which is 80 nits still in the SDR Output Color Space.
  * Default For Color Space `default` - Will use either the SDR or the HDR Reference White, based on the color space detected/selected.
  * Standard (SDR) `sdr` - Will treat the Output Color Space as SDR for it's reference white value.
  * High (HDR) `hdr` - Will treat the Output Color Space as HDR for it's reference white value.

## Parameters - Common Page
- Output Resolution `outputresolution` - ⊞ - quickly change the resolution of the TOP's data.
  * Use Input `useinput` - Uses the input's resolution.
  * Eighth `eighth` - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount.
  * Quarter `quarter` - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount.
  * Half `half` - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount.
  * 2X `2x` - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount.
  * 4X `4x` - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount.
  * 8X `8x` - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount.
  * Fit Resolution `fit` - Fits the width and height to the resolution given below, while maintaining the aspect ratio.
  * Limit Resolution `limit` - The width and height are limited to the resolution given below. If one of the dimensions exceeds the given resolution, the width and height will be reduced to fit inside the given limits while maintaining the aspect ratio.
  * Custom Resolution `custom` - Enables the Resolution parameter below, giving direct control over width and height.

- Resolution `resolution` - ⊞ - Enabled only when the Resolution parameter is set to Custom Resolution. Some Generators like Constant and Ramp do not use inputs and only use this field to determine their size. The drop down menu on the right provides some commonly used resolutions.
  * W `resolutionw` -
  * H `resolutionh` -

- Resolution Menu `resmenu` - A drop-down menu with some commonly used resolutions.
- Use Global Res Multiplier `resmult` - Uses the Global Resolution Multiplier found in **Edit >Preferences>TOPs**. This multiplies all the TOPs resolutions by the set amount. This is handy when working on computers with different hardware specifications. If a project is designed on a desktop workstation with lots of graphics memory, a user on a laptop with only 64MB VRAM can set the Global Resolution Multiplier to a value of half or quarter so it runs at an acceptable speed. By checking this checkbox on, this TOP is affected by the global multiplier.
- Output Aspect `outputaspect` - ⊞ - Sets the image aspect ratio allowing any textures to be viewed in any size. Watch for unexpected results when compositing TOPs with different aspect ratios. (You can define images with non-square pixels using xres, yres, aspectx, aspecty where xres/yres != aspectx/aspecty.)
  * Use Input `useinput` - Uses the input's aspect ratio.
  * Resolution `resolution` - Uses the aspect of the image's defined resolution (ie 512x256 would be 2:1), whereby each pixel is square.
  * Custom Aspect `custom` - Lets you explicitly define a custom aspect ratio in the Aspect parameter below.

- Aspect `aspect` - ⊞ - Use when Output Aspect parameter is set to Custom Aspect.
  * Aspect1 `aspect1` -
  * Aspect2 `aspect2` -

- Aspect Menu `armenu` - A drop-down menu with some commonly used aspect ratios.
- Input Smoothness `inputfiltertype` - ⊞ - This controls pixel filtering on the input image of the TOP.
  * Nearest Pixel `nearest` - Uses nearest pixel or accurate image representation. Images will look jaggy when viewing at any zoom level other than Native Resolution.
  * Interpolate Pixels `linear` - Uses linear filtering between pixels. This is how you get TOP images in viewers to look good at various zoom levels, especially useful when using any Fill Viewer setting other than Native Resolution.
  * Mipmap Pixels `mipmap` - Uses [ mipmap](https://docs.derivative.ca/Mipmapping "Mipmapping") filtering when scaling images. This can be used to reduce artifacts and sparkling in moving/scaling images that have lots of detail.

- Fill Viewer `fillmode` - ⊞ - Determine how the TOP image is displayed in the viewer.
**NOTE:** To get an understanding of how TOPs work with images, you will want to set this to **Native Resolution** as you lay down TOPs when starting out. This will let you see what is actually happening without any automatic viewer resizing.
  * Use Input `useinput` - Uses the same Fill Viewer settings as it's input.
  * Fill `fill` - Stretches the image to fit the edges of the viewer.
  * Fit Horizontal `width` - Stretches image to fit viewer horizontally.
  * Fit Vertical `height` - Stretches image to fit viewer vertically.
  * Fit Best `best` - Stretches or squashes image so no part of image is cropped.
  * Fit Outside `outside` - Stretches or squashes image so image fills viewer while constraining it's proportions. This often leads to part of image getting cropped by viewer.
  * Native Resolution `nativeres` - Displays the native resolution of the image in the viewer.

- Viewer Smoothness `filtertype` - ⊞ - This controls pixel filtering in the viewers.
  * Nearest Pixel `nearest` - Uses nearest pixel or accurate image representation. Images will look jaggy when viewing at any zoom level other than Native Resolution.
  * Interpolate Pixels `linear` - Uses linear filtering between pixels. Use this to get TOP images in viewers to look good at various zoom levels, especially useful when using any Fill Viewer setting other than Native Resolution.
  * Mipmap Pixels `mipmap` - Uses [ mipmap](https://docs.derivative.ca/Mipmapping "Mipmapping") filtering when scaling images. This can be used to reduce artifacts and sparkling in moving/scaling images that have lots of detail.

- Passes `npasses` - Duplicates the operation of the TOP the specified number of times.

The Alpha channel in this format will always be 1. Values can go above one, but can't be negative. ie. the range is [0, infinite).
  * 16-bit float (RGB) `rgb16float` -
  * 32-bit float (RGB) `rgb32float` -
