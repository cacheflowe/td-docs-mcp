# Transform TOP
## Summary

The Transform TOP applies 2D transformations to a TOP image like translate, scale, rotate, and multi-repeat tiling. The background can be filled with solid color and alpha.
[transformTOP_Class](https://docs.derivative.ca/TransformTOP_Class "TransformTOP Class")

## Parameters - Transform Page
- Transform Order `xord` - ⊞ - The menu attached to this parameter allows you to specify the order in which the changes to your TOP will take place. Changing the Transform order will change where things go much the same way as going a block and turning east gets you to a different place than turning east and then going a block.
  * Scale Rotate Translate `srt` -
  * Scale Translate Rotate `str` -
  * Rotate Scale Translate `rst` -
  * Rotate Translate Scale `rts` -
  * Translate Scale Rotate `tsr` -
  * Translate Rotate Scale `trs` -

- Translate `t` - ⊞ - The two fields for Translate allows you to specify transforms in x and y axes.
  * X `tx` -
  * Y `ty` -

- Translate Unit `tunit` - Sets the units used in the Translate parameter.
- Rotate `rotate` - The field for rotation allows you to specify the amount of rotation of the image.
- Scale `s` - ⊞ - The two fields for Scale allows you to specify transforms in x and y axes.
  * X `sx` -
  * Y `sy` -

- Grow / Shrink `growshrink` - ⊞ - Grow/Shrink is a scale that is given in pixel units. A positive value will cause the image to grow that many pixels while a negative will cause the image to shrink that many pixels.
  * X `growshrinkx` -
  * Y `growshrinky` -

- Pivot `p` - ⊞ - The Pivot point edit fields allow you to define the point about which the TOP scales and rotates. Altering the pivot point of a TOP produces different results depending on the transformation performed on the TOP image.
For example, during a scaling operation, if the pivot point of a TOP image is located at `-1,-1` and you wanted to scale the image by `0.5` (reduce its size by 50%), then the TOP would scale toward the pivot point and appear to slide down and to the left.
  * X `px` -
  * Y `py` -

- Pivot Unit `punit` - Sets the units used in the Pivot parameter.
- Backgound Color `bgcolor` - ⊞ - Color applied behind the foreground image. The background is visible when the image is translated or scaled down. Try scaling an image down 50% in size (Scale = 0.5,0.5) and setting the background color.
  * Red `bgcolorr` -
  * Green `bgcolorg` -
  * Blue `bgcolorb` -
  * Alpha `bgcolora` -

- Pre-Multiply RGB by Alpha `premultrgbbyalpha` - This option allows the Background Color to be pre-multiplied by alpha.
- Comp Over Background Color `compover` - Fill any area with the background color if it has alpha less than 1.
- Mipmap Bias `mipmapbias` - If the input is sampled using mipmapping, this applies a bias to which mip level(s) are used when sampling the texture. 0 means the levels that would be normally used. Negative will selected higher levels (larger textures), positive will select lower (smaller texture) levels. 1 is equal to 1 mip level. This parameter is enabled in the 'Input Smoothness' parameter is set to 'Mipmap Pixels'.

## Parameters - Tile Page
- Extend `extend` - ⊞ - This parameter determines what happens at the edges of the tiles.
  * Hold `hold` - The pixel values at the edges of the tile continue to extend past that edge.
  * Zero `zero` - The image does not extend past the edges of the tile.
  * Repeat `repeat` - The image is repeated at the edges of the tile.
  * Mirror `mirror` - The image is mirrored at the edges of the tile.

- Limit Tiles `limittiles` - Turn this On to limit the number of tiles in the U and V directions using the parameters below.
- Tile U `tileu` - ⊞ - The first Tile U parameter sets the number of tiles to repeat on the left of the source image. The second Tile U parameter sets the number of tiles to repeat on the right of the source image. The image must be scaled down (using the Scale parameters on the Transform page) to view these tiles.
  * `tileu1` -
  * `tileu2` -

- Tile V `tilev` - ⊞ - The first Tile V parameter sets the number of tiles to repeat on the botttom of the source image. The second Tile V parameter sets the number of tiles to repeat on the top of the source image. The image must be scaled down (using the Scale parameters on the Transform page) to view these tiles.
  * `tilev1` -
  * `tilev2` -

## Parameters - Common Page
- Output Resolution `outputresolution` - ⊞ - quickly change the resolution of the TOP's data.
  * Use Input `useinput` - Uses the input's resolution.
  * Eighth `eighth` - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount.
  * Quarter `quarter` - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount.
  * Half `half` - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount.
  * 2X `2x` - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount.
  * 4X `4x` - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount.
  * 8X `8x` - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount.
  * Fit Resolution `fit` - Fits the width and height to the resolution given below, while maintaining the aspect ratio.
  * Limit Resolution `limit` - The width and height are limited to the resolution given below. If one of the dimensions exceeds the given resolution, the width and height will be reduced to fit inside the given limits while maintaining the aspect ratio.
  * Custom Resolution `custom` - Enables the Resolution parameter below, giving direct control over width and height.

- Resolution `resolution` - ⊞ - Enabled only when the Resolution parameter is set to Custom Resolution. Some Generators like Constant and Ramp do not use inputs and only use this field to determine their size. The drop down menu on the right provides some commonly used resolutions.
  * W `resolutionw` -
  * H `resolutionh` -

- Resolution Menu `resmenu` - A drop-down menu with some commonly used resolutions.
- Use Global Res Multiplier `resmult` - Uses the Global Resolution Multiplier found in **Edit >Preferences>TOPs**. This multiplies all the TOPs resolutions by the set amount. This is handy when working on computers with different hardware specifications. If a project is designed on a desktop workstation with lots of graphics memory, a user on a laptop with only 64MB VRAM can set the Global Resolution Multiplier to a value of half or quarter so it runs at an acceptable speed. By checking this checkbox on, this TOP is affected by the global multiplier.
- Output Aspect `outputaspect` - ⊞ - Sets the image aspect ratio allowing any textures to be viewed in any size. Watch for unexpected results when compositing TOPs with different aspect ratios. (You can define images with non-square pixels using xres, yres, aspectx, aspecty where xres/yres != aspectx/aspecty.)
  * Use Input `useinput` - Uses the input's aspect ratio.
  * Resolution `resolution` - Uses the aspect of the image's defined resolution (ie 512x256 would be 2:1), whereby each pixel is square.
  * Custom Aspect `custom` - Lets you explicitly define a custom aspect ratio in the Aspect parameter below.

- Aspect `aspect` - ⊞ - Use when Output Aspect parameter is set to Custom Aspect.
  * Aspect1 `aspect1` -
  * Aspect2 `aspect2` -

- Aspect Menu `armenu` - A drop-down menu with some commonly used aspect ratios.
- Input Smoothness `inputfiltertype` - ⊞ - This controls pixel filtering on the input image of the TOP.
  * Nearest Pixel `nearest` - Uses nearest pixel or accurate image representation. Images will look jaggy when viewing at any zoom level other than Native Resolution.
  * Interpolate Pixels `linear` - Uses linear filtering between pixels. This is how you get TOP images in viewers to look good at various zoom levels, especially useful when using any Fill Viewer setting other than Native Resolution.
  * Mipmap Pixels `mipmap` - Uses [ mipmap](https://docs.derivative.ca/Mipmapping "Mipmapping") filtering when scaling images. This can be used to reduce artifacts and sparkling in moving/scaling images that have lots of detail.

- Fill Viewer `fillmode` - ⊞ - Determine how the TOP image is displayed in the viewer.
**NOTE:** To get an understanding of how TOPs work with images, you will want to set this to **Native Resolution** as you lay down TOPs when starting out. This will let you see what is actually happening without any automatic viewer resizing.
  * Use Input `useinput` - Uses the same Fill Viewer settings as it's input.
  * Fill `fill` - Stretches the image to fit the edges of the viewer.
  * Fit Horizontal `width` - Stretches image to fit viewer horizontally.
  * Fit Vertical `height` - Stretches image to fit viewer vertically.
  * Fit Best `best` - Stretches or squashes image so no part of image is cropped.
  * Fit Outside `outside` - Stretches or squashes image so image fills viewer while constraining it's proportions. This often leads to part of image getting cropped by viewer.
  * Native Resolution `nativeres` - Displays the native resolution of the image in the viewer.

- Viewer Smoothness `filtertype` - ⊞ - This controls pixel filtering in the viewers.
  * Nearest Pixel `nearest` - Uses nearest pixel or accurate image representation. Images will look jaggy when viewing at any zoom level other than Native Resolution.
  * Interpolate Pixels `linear` - Uses linear filtering between pixels. Use this to get TOP images in viewers to look good at various zoom levels, especially useful when using any Fill Viewer setting other than Native Resolution.
  * Mipmap Pixels `mipmap` - Uses [ mipmap](https://docs.derivative.ca/Mipmapping "Mipmapping") filtering when scaling images. This can be used to reduce artifacts and sparkling in moving/scaling images that have lots of detail.

  * Standard (SDR) `sdr` - Will treat the Parameter Color Space as SDR for it's reference white value.
  * High (HDR) `hdr` - Will treat the Parameter Color Space as HDR for it's reference white value.
  * UI `ui` - Will treat the Parameter Color Space as UI for it's reference white value. This uses the 'UI Reference White Nits' value for it's brightness.
