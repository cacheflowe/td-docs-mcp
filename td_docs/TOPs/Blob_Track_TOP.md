# Blob Track TOP
## Summary

The Blob Track TOP is implemented using [OpenCV](https://opencv.org//).
To get the results of the Blob Track TOP, attach an [Info DAT](https://docs.derivative.ca/Info_DAT "Info DAT") or [Info CHOP](https://docs.derivative.ca/Info_CHOP "Info CHOP") to it. The Info reports the current blob IDs, coordinates and sizes in pixels. The blob ID increases for every new blob that is detected.
It converts the incoming image to monochrome (since it operates on an single color channel), but to better prepare the image, preceed it with a Monochrome TOP followed by a Luma Level TOP, and adjust Black Level, Brightness and Gamma.
Typical usage is connecting a video source (such as [Video Device In TOP](https://docs.derivative.ca/Video_Device_In_TOP "Video Device In TOP") to the Blob Track TOP).
**NOTE:** can track an unlimited number of blobs in Pro and Commercial, and up to 2 blobs in the Non-Commercial version of TouchDesigner.

## Usage
There are two workflows with the Blob Track TOP.
###
SimpleBlobDetector
[SimpleBlobDetector](https://docs.opencv.org/3.4/d0/d7a/classcv_1_1SimpleBlobDetector.html) is a blob detection algorithm in OpenCV. This method will automatically be used if **only** the first input is connected. SimpleBlobDetector has the benefit of not requiring a known background to detect blobs but only returns blobs as a position and radius, meaning that all blobs rectangles will be square. The SimpleBlobDetector can also be quite slow so lowering the input resolution is often necessary. Generally this method should only be used if the background is not known.

###
Background Subtraction
Background subtraction will automatically be used if there is a second input connected. Background subtraction is less dynamic and requires a known background to function but it offers a massive performance improvement over SimpleBlobDetector, and unlike with SimpleBlobDetector the blob rectangles using this method are not restricted to squares only. The background subtraction method will create a binary image from the first and second input (based off the threshold parameter) and then use OpenCV to find contours and convert those to rectangles.

## Parameters - Blob Track Page
- Reset `reset` - Resets all tracking data and learned background data while this parameter is On.
- Reset Pulse `resetpulse` - Instantly resets all tracking data and learned background data.
- Mono Source `monosource` - ⊞ - Blob tracking is done using a single channel. This menu controls what single channel is used to detect blobs.
  * Luminance `luminance` -
  * Red `red` -
  * Green `green` -
  * Blue `blue` -
  * Alpha `alpha` -
  * RGB Average `rgbaverage` -
  * RGBA Average `average` -

- Draw Blob Bounds `drawblobs` - Draws rectangles on the TOP image that shows where the tracked blobs are.
- Blob Bound Color `blobcolor` - ⊞ - Determines the color of the rectangles that are drawn to show the blobs.
  * Red `blobcolorr` -
  * Green `blobcolorg` -
  * Blue `blobcolorb` -

- Threshold `threshold` - Threshold used to create the binary texture when using background subtraction. It is the threshold of the difference between the background texture and the input texture.
- Download Type `downloadtype` - ⊞ - Gives the option for a delayed data download from the GPU, which is much faster and does not stall the render.
  * Immediate (Slow) `immediate` - Get the current frame's output. Slower.
  * Next Frame (Fast) `delayed` - Get the previous frame's output. Faster.

## Parameters - Constraints Page
- Minimum Blob Size `minblobsize` - Blobs must be at least this big to be tracked.
- Maximum Blob Size `maxblobsize` - Blobs larger than this will not be tracked.
- Maximum Move Distance `maxmovedistance` - The maximum distance a blob can move in one frame and still be considered to the same blob (maintain the same ID).
- Delete Nearby Blobs `deletenearby` - Sometimes (depending on the tracking method) duplicate blobs may be created. This feature allows you to delete blobs that are too close to each other.
- Minimum Distance `deletedist` - When deleting nearby blobs, blobs will be deleted if they are within this number of pixels of each other. The smaller blob will be deleted.
- Delete Area Tolerance `deletenearbytol` - Along with the distance, the area of the two blobs can be compared. If this parameter is 1, than the area is ignored. As this parameter gets smaller only blobs that have a significant size difference (between the two blobs being compared) will be deleted.
- Delete Overlapping Blobs `deleteoverlap` - Deletes blobs that are overlapping.
- Delete Overlap Tolerance `deleteoverlaptol` - If this parameter is 1 then only blobs that are completely overlapped will be deleted. As this value gets smaller less and less overlap is needed for a blob to get deleted.

## Parameters - Revival Page
- Revive Blobs `reviveblobs` - When enabled, will revive lost blobs (ie. same ID) if they satisfy all the below parameters
- Revive Time `revivetime` - The time (in seconds) threshold for reviving a lost blob. If a blob has been lost for longer than revive time, it will not be revived and is considered expired.
- Revive Area Difference `revivearea` - The area difference threshold for the new blob and the lost blob.
- Revive Distance `revivedistance` - The distance threshold between the new blob and the lost blob.
- Include Lost Blobs in Table `includelost` - When enabled, lost blobs will be included in the Blob Track TOP's Info DAT table.
- Include Expired Blobs in Table `includeexpired` - When enabled, expired blobs (ie. blobs that have no chance of revival) will be included in the Blob Track TOP's Info DAT table.
- Expired Time `expiredtime` - Time in seconds for blobs to remain in the Info DAT table after expiring.

## Parameters - Common Page
- Output Resolution `outputresolution` - ⊞ - quickly change the resolution of the TOP's data.
  * Use Input `useinput` - Uses the input's resolution.
  * Eighth `eighth` - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount.
  * Quarter `quarter` - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount.
  * Half `half` - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount.
  * 2X `2x` - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount.
  * 4X `4x` - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount.
  * 8X `8x` - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount.
  * Fit Resolution `fit` - Fits the width and height to the resolution given below, while maintaining the aspect ratio.
  * Limit Resolution `limit` - The width and height are limited to the resolution given below. If one of the dimensions exceeds the given resolution, the width and height will be reduced to fit inside the given limits while maintaining the aspect ratio.
  * Custom Resolution `custom` - Enables the Resolution parameter below, giving direct control over width and height.

- Resolution `resolution` - ⊞ - Enabled only when the Resolution parameter is set to Custom Resolution. Some Generators like Constant and Ramp do not use inputs and only use this field to determine their size. The drop down menu on the right provides some commonly used resolutions.
  * W `resolutionw` -
  * H `resolutionh` -

- Resolution Menu `resmenu` - A drop-down menu with some commonly used resolutions.
- Use Global Res Multiplier `resmult` - Uses the Global Resolution Multiplier found in **Edit >Preferences>TOPs**. This multiplies all the TOPs resolutions by the set amount. This is handy when working on computers with different hardware specifications. If a project is designed on a desktop workstation with lots of graphics memory, a user on a laptop with only 64MB VRAM can set the Global Resolution Multiplier to a value of half or quarter so it runs at an acceptable speed. By checking this checkbox on, this TOP is affected by the global multiplier.
- Output Aspect `outputaspect` - ⊞ - Sets the image aspect ratio allowing any textures to be viewed in any size. Watch for unexpected results when compositing TOPs with different aspect ratios. (You can define images with non-square pixels using xres, yres, aspectx, aspecty where xres/yres != aspectx/aspecty.)
  * Use Input `useinput` - Uses the input's aspect ratio.
  * Resolution `resolution` - Uses the aspect of the image's defined resolution (ie 512x256 would be 2:1), whereby each pixel is square.
  * Custom Aspect `custom` - Lets you explicitly define a custom aspect ratio in the Aspect parameter below.

- Aspect `aspect` - ⊞ - Use when Output Aspect parameter is set to Custom Aspect.
  * Aspect1 `aspect1` -
  * Aspect2 `aspect2` -

- Aspect Menu `armenu` - A drop-down menu with some commonly used aspect ratios.
- Input Smoothness `inputfiltertype` - ⊞ - This controls pixel filtering on the input image of the TOP.
  * Nearest Pixel `nearest` - Uses nearest pixel or accurate image representation. Images will look jaggy when viewing at any zoom level other than Native Resolution.
  * Interpolate Pixels `linear` - Uses linear filtering between pixels. This is how you get TOP images in viewers to look good at various zoom levels, especially useful when using any Fill Viewer setting other than Native Resolution.
  * Mipmap Pixels `mipmap` - Uses [ mipmap](https://docs.derivative.ca/Mipmapping "Mipmapping") filtering when scaling images. This can be used to reduce artifacts and sparkling in moving/scaling images that have lots of detail.

- Fill Viewer `fillmode` - ⊞ - Determine how the TOP image is displayed in the viewer.
**NOTE:** To get an understanding of how TOPs work with images, you will want to set this to **Native Resolution** as you lay down TOPs when starting out. This will let you see what is actually happening without any automatic viewer resizing.
  * Use Input `useinput` - Uses the same Fill Viewer settings as it's input.
  * Fill `fill` - Stretches the image to fit the edges of the viewer.
  * Fit Horizontal `width` - Stretches image to fit viewer horizontally.
  * Fit Vertical `height` - Stretches image to fit viewer vertically.
  * Fit Best `best` - Stretches or squashes image so no part of image is cropped.
  * Fit Outside `outside` - Stretches or squashes image so image fills viewer while constraining it's proportions. This often leads to part of image getting cropped by viewer.
  * Native Resolution `nativeres` - Displays the native resolution of the image in the viewer.

- Viewer Smoothness `filtertype` - ⊞ - This controls pixel filtering in the viewers.
  * Nearest Pixel `nearest` - Uses nearest pixel or accurate image representation. Images will look jaggy when viewing at any zoom level other than Native Resolution.
  * Interpolate Pixels `linear` - Uses linear filtering between pixels. Use this to get TOP images in viewers to look good at various zoom levels, especially useful when using any Fill Viewer setting other than Native Resolution.
  * Mipmap Pixels `mipmap` - Uses [ mipmap](https://docs.derivative.ca/Mipmapping "Mipmapping") filtering when scaling images. This can be used to reduce artifacts and sparkling in moving/scaling images that have lots of detail.

- Parameter Color Space `parmcolorspace` - ⊞ - Controls how all color parameters on this node are interpreted. The color values as treated as being in the selected color space, and are converted to the Working [Color Space](https://docs.derivative.ca/Color_Space "Color Space") before they are used as part of the node's operation. Note that this does not change the color space of the node itself, as that is always in the Working Color Space.
  * sRGB `srgb` - [sRGB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SRGB) color space, with sRGB transfer function. Considered an SDR color space with respect to Reference White.
  * sRGB - Linear `srgblinear` - [sRGB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SRGB) color space, with linear transfer function. Considered an SDR color space with respect to Reference White.

If the Working Color Space is the same Reference White, then no adjustment is done. If they are different, then the Reference White level (brightness) of this color will be adjusted to the range expected by the Working Color Space. For example if the project is set to have a SDR Reference White of 120 nits, and the HDR Reference White is 80 nits, then a color of (1, 1, 1), which is 120 nits in the SDR color space, will be converted to be (1.5, 1.5, 1.5), which is 120 nits still in the HDR Working Color Space.
  * Default For Color Space `default` - Will use either the SDR or the HDR Reference White, based on the color space selected.
  * Use Parent Panel `useparent` - Will use the Reference White that the parent panel has selected. If the top-level panel also has 'Use Parent' selected, then 'UI Reference White' will be used.
  * Standard (SDR) `sdr` - Will treat the Parameter Color Space as SDR for it's reference white value.
  * High (HDR) `hdr` - Will treat the Parameter Color Space as HDR for it's reference white value.
  * UI `ui` - Will treat the Parameter Color Space as UI for it's reference white value. This uses the 'UI Reference White Nits' value for it's brightness.
