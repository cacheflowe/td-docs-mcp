# GLSL TOP
## Summary

The GLSL TOP renders a GLSL [shader](https://docs.derivative.ca/Shader "Shader") into a TOP image. Use the Info DAT to check for compile errors in your shaders.
The GLSL TOP can act as a pixel shader, or the more general and complex [Compute Shader](https://docs.derivative.ca/Compute_Shader "Compute Shader"). Caveat: Compute Shaders need GLSL 4.30 or later.
The GLSL TOP has one docked compute shader as well as a normal GLSL shader. Change he Mode to Compute Shader. it will use the `glsl1_compute` DAT.

**Refer to the[Write a GLSL TOP](https://docs.derivative.ca/Write_a_GLSL_TOP "Write a GLSL TOP") article for more info on using this TOP.**

See the [GLSL Category](https://docs.derivative.ca/Category:GLSL "Category:GLSL") for more information, and [Compute Shader](https://docs.derivative.ca/Compute_Shader "Compute Shader").

  * Vertex/Pixel Shader `vertexpixel` -
  * Compute Shader `compute` -

- Preprocess Directives `predat` - Use this DAT to place preprocessor directives at the start of your shader, such as #extension. This is required since these need to be the first lines in the shader, and TouchDesigner will be adding code to the start of your shader to declare uniforms/functions which would appear before #extension directives located in the main shader. #include statements should be avoided unless include-guards are in the DATs. This should **not** be used for pre-prending common code to your shaders. Use #include statements in the main shader to do that.
- Vertex Shader `vertexdat` - Points to the [DAT](https://docs.derivative.ca/DAT "DAT") holding the Vertex Shader. Drag & Drop a DAT here, or manually enter the path to the DAT.
- Pixel Shader `pixeldat` - Points to the [DAT](https://docs.derivative.ca/DAT "DAT") holding the Pixel Shader. Drag & Drop a DAT here, or manually enter the path to the DAT.
- Compute Shader `computedat` - Points to the [DAT](https://docs.derivative.ca/DAT "DAT") holding the [Compute Shader](https://docs.derivative.ca/Compute_Shader "Compute Shader"). Drag & Drop a DAT here, or manually enter the path to the DAT.

  * Show Checkerboard `showcheckerboard` -
  * Show Black `showblack` -
  * Show Previous Shader `showprevious` -

- Load Uniform Names `loaduniformnames` - When this button is pressed the node will try to pre-fill all it's uniform parameter with uniforms that are declare in the shader. Note that the shader compiler will likely not expose uniforms that are unused.
- Dispatch Size `dispatchsize` - ⊞ - The dispatch size to use when executing a compute shader.
  * X `dispatchsizex` -
  * Y `dispatchsizey` -
  * Z `dispatchsizez` -

  * Write Only `writeonly` - The texture will only be written to by the shader, not read.
  * Read-Write `readwrite` - The texture will be both written and read by the shader.

- Output Type `type` - ⊞ - Specify what type of texture to create. When creating a 3D texture the TOP will render once for every slice of the output. Refer to [ 3D Textures and 2D Texture Arrays](https://docs.derivative.ca/Write_a_GLSL_TOP#3D_Textures_and_2D_Texture_Arrays "Write a GLSL TOP") for more info.
  * 2D Texture `texture2d` - Creates a 2D texture.

  * Performance `performance` - Performant noise.

  * Quality `quality` - Quality noise.

## Parameters - Colors Page
Like the Vectors page, these are simple uniforms. These uniforms should always be declared as `vec4`. However, the values in these parameters are interpreted according to the Parameter Color Space menus for this node. They will convert the color values in the parameters to the [Working Color Space](https://docs.derivative.ca/Working_Color_Space "Working Color Space") before passing them to the shader, if a Working Color Space is active.
- Pre-Multiply RGB by Alpha `premultrgbbyalpha` - Multiplies the RGB values in all the Color parameters by their Alpha value, before passing them to the shader.
- Color `color` -
- Name `color0name` - The name of the uniform in the shader to assign this color value to.
- RGB `color0rgb` - ⊞ - The RGB values for this uniform.
  * RGB `color0rgbr` -
  * RGB `color0rgbg` -
  * RGB `color0rgbb` -

- Alpha `color0alpha` - The Alpha value for this uniform.

## Parameters - Vectors Page
These are passed as uniforms into your shader. Depending on how the uniform is declared only some of the values of the 4 available per parameter as passes to the shader. For example, if the uniform is declared as a vec2, then only the first 2 values are passed to the shader, the other 2 are ignored.
- Vector `vec` - Sequence of vector uniforms
- Name `vec0name` - The uniform name, as declared in the shader
- Value `vec0value` - ⊞ - The value(s) to give the uniform.
  * Value `vec0valuex` -
  * Value `vec0valuey` -
  * Value `vec0valuez` -
  * Value `vec0valuew` -

## Parameters - Arrays Page
CHOP Uniforms allow you to send CHOP channel data into a GLSL shader as an array. Depending on the array type used, the number of values you can send into the shader may be limited. If you are using Uniform Arrays, you can use the Built-In variable `int(var('SYS_GFX_GLSL_MAX_UNIFORMS'))` to get an idea of how many values you can pass to the shader. Current GPUs are vec4 based for uniform arrays, so the maximum array size is `int(var('SYS_GFX_GLSL_MAX_UNIFORMS')) / 4`. Other uniforms will take away from this maximum. If you are using Texture Buffers the maximum array size is far bigger, `int(var('SYS_GFX_MAX_TEXTURE_BUFFER_SIZE'))` will tell you the max for this. The max for texture buffer is per texture buffer, and having multiple texture buffers does not take away from the max for each array.
- Array `array` - Sequence of array uniforms
- Name `array0name` - The name of the uniform. You can send up to 4 channels into the GLSL shader in a single uniform. The number of channels is determined by the float/vec2/vec3/vec4 menu to the right of the name. For a CHOP with a single channel declare your uniform as a float, for one with two channels declare your uniform as a vec2, etc. The data is interleaved in the uniform. I.e the .x component is the 1st channel, .y is the 2nd channel, etc.
- Type `array0type` - ⊞ - The data type of the uniform in the shader.
  * float `float` -
  * vec2 `vec2` -
  * vec3 `vec3` -
  * vec4 `vec4` -

- CHOP `array0chop` - The channels from this CHOP will be sent to the GLSL shader.
- Array Type `array0arraytype` - ⊞ - The type of the uniform.
  * Uniform Array `uniformarray` - All GPUs can send array data into a GLSL shader using Uniform Arrays.
  * Texture Buffer `texturebuffer` - Newer GPUs can send array data into a GLSL shader using Texture Buffers. Texture Buffers use texture memory and texture fetches to access the data, which allows them to store many more values.

Declare them:
```
uniform samplerBuffer <uniformname>;

```

And sample them like this
```
vec4 val = texelFetch(<uniformname>, i);

```

Where i is the 0-based index (an integer) into the buffer that you want to get a value for.

## Parameters - Matrices Page
- Matrix `matrix` - Sequence of matrix uniforms
- Name `matrix0name` - The name of the matrix uniform.
- Matrix `matrix0value` - The value to assign the matrix. For valid ways to specify this, see the [Matrix Parameters](https://docs.derivative.ca/Matrix_Parameters "Matrix Parameters") article.

## Parameters - Atomic Counters Page
- Atomic Counter `ac` - Sequence of atomic counter uniforms
- Name `ac0name` - The name of the uniform.
- Initial Value Type `ac0initvalue` - ⊞ - Specifies how the atomic counters receive their initial value, either through a single default value or a CHOP.
  * Single Value `val` -
  * CHOP Values `chop` -

- Initial Value `ac0singlevalue` - Specifies a single value that all atomic counters in this binding will be initialized to.
- Initial Values CHOP `ac0chopvalue` - A reference to the CHOP that will determine the initial values of the atomic counters in this binding. The CHOP will be spanned in track order, so the values from the first track will be read in order first, then the next track (if there is one) and so on. If there are more initial values to fill than there are values in the CHOP then they will all be set to 0. Atomic counters will be initialized from low to high offsets.

## Parameters - Constants Page
[Specialization Constants](https://docs.derivative.ca/Write_a_GLSL_TOP#Specialization_Constants "Write a GLSL TOP") can optionally have their values assigned here.

- Name `const0name` - The constant name, as declared in the shader.
- Value `const0value` - The value to give the constant.

## Parameters - Buffers Page

## Parameters - Common Page
- Output Resolution `outputresolution` - ⊞ - quickly change the resolution of the TOP's data.
  * Use Input `useinput` - Uses the input's resolution.
  * Eighth `eighth` - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount.
  * Quarter `quarter` - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount.
  * Half `half` - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount.

  * Custom Resolution `custom` - Enables the Resolution parameter below, giving direct control over width and height.

- Resolution `resolution` - ⊞ - Enabled only when the Resolution parameter is set to Custom Resolution. Some Generators like Constant and Ramp do not use inputs and only use this field to determine their size. The drop down menu on the right provides some commonly used resolutions.
  * W `resolutionw` -
  * H `resolutionh` -

- Resolution Menu `resmenu` - A drop-down menu with some commonly used resolutions.
- Use Global Res Multiplier `resmult` - Uses the Global Resolution Multiplier found in **Edit >Preferences>TOPs**. This multiplies all the TOPs resolutions by the set amount. This is handy when working on computers with different hardware specifications. If a project is designed on a desktop workstation with lots of graphics memory, a user on a laptop with only 64MB VRAM can set the Global Resolution Multiplier to a value of half or quarter so it runs at an acceptable speed. By checking this checkbox on, this TOP is affected by the global multiplier.
- Output Aspect `outputaspect` - ⊞ - Sets the image aspect ratio allowing any textures to be viewed in any size. Watch for unexpected results when compositing TOPs with different aspect ratios. (You can define images with non-square pixels using xres, yres, aspectx, aspecty where xres/yres != aspectx/aspecty.)
  * Use Input `useinput` - Uses the input's aspect ratio.
  * Resolution `resolution` - Uses the aspect of the image's defined resolution (ie 512x256 would be 2:1), whereby each pixel is square.

- Input Smoothness `inputfiltertype` - ⊞ - This controls pixel filtering on the input image of the TOP.
  * Nearest Pixel `nearest` - Uses nearest pixel or accurate image representation. Images will look jaggy when viewing at any zoom level other than Native Resolution.
  * Interpolate Pixels `linear` - Uses linear filtering between pixels. This is how you get TOP images in viewers to look good at various zoom levels, especially useful when using any Fill Viewer setting other than Native Resolution.
  * Mipmap Pixels `mipmap` - Uses [ mipmap](https://docs.derivative.ca/Mipmapping "Mipmapping") filtering when scaling images. This can be used to reduce artifacts and sparkling in moving/scaling images that have lots of detail.

- Fill Viewer `fillmode` - ⊞ - Determine how the TOP image is displayed in the viewer.
**NOTE:** To get an understanding of how TOPs work with images, you will want to set this to **Native Resolution** as you lay down TOPs when starting out. This will let you see what is actually happening without any automatic viewer resizing.
  * Use Input `useinput` - Uses the same Fill Viewer settings as it's input.
  * Fill `fill` - Stretches the image to fit the edges of the viewer.
  * Fit Horizontal `width` - Stretches image to fit viewer horizontally.
  * Fit Vertical `height` - Stretches image to fit viewer vertically.
  * Fit Best `best` - Stretches or squashes image so no part of image is cropped.
  * Fit Outside `outside` - Stretches or squashes image so image fills viewer while constraining it's proportions. This often leads to part of image getting cropped by viewer.
  * Native Resolution `nativeres` - Displays the native resolution of the image in the viewer.

- Viewer Smoothness `filtertype` - ⊞ - This controls pixel filtering in the viewers.
  * Nearest Pixel `nearest` - Uses nearest pixel or accurate image representation. Images will look jaggy when viewing at any zoom level other than Native Resolution.

- Passes `npasses` - Duplicates the operation of the TOP the specified number of times. Making this larger than 1 is essentially the same as taking the output from each pass, and passing it into the first input of the node and repeating the process. Other inputs and parameters remain the same for each pass.
- Channel Mask `chanmask` - Allows you to choose which channels (R, G, B, or A) the TOP will operate on. All channels are selected by default.

The color values as treated as being in the selected color space, and are converted to the Working [Color Space](https://docs.derivative.ca/Color_Space "Color Space") before they are used as part of the node's operation. Note that this does not change the color space of the node itself, as that is always in the Working Color Space.
  * sRGB `srgb` - [sRGB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SRGB) color space, with sRGB transfer function. Considered an SDR color space with respect to Reference White.

[Parameter Color Space Parameters](https://docs.derivative.ca/index.php?title=Parameter_Color_Space_Parameters&action=edit&redlink=1 "Parameter Color Space Parameters \(page does not exist\)")
## Parameters - Common Page
- Output Resolution `outputresolution` - ⊞ - quickly change the resolution of the TOP's data.
  * Use Input `useinput` - Uses the input's resolution.
  * Eighth `eighth` - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount.
  * Quarter `quarter` - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount.
  * Half `half` - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount.
  * 2X `2x` - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount.
  * 4X `4x` - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount.
  * 8X `8x` - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount.
  * Fit Resolution `fit` - Fits the width and height to the resolution given below, while maintaining the aspect ratio.
  * Limit Resolution `limit` - The width and height are limited to the resolution given below. If one of the dimensions exceeds the given resolution, the width and height will be reduced to fit inside the given limits while maintaining the aspect ratio.
  * Custom Resolution `custom` - Enables the Resolution parameter below, giving direct control over width and height.

- Resolution `resolution` - ⊞ - Enabled only when the Resolution parameter is set to Custom Resolution. Some Generators like Constant and Ramp do not use inputs and only use this field to determine their size. The drop down menu on the right provides some commonly used resolutions.
  * W `resolutionw` -
  * H `resolutionh` -

- Resolution Menu `resmenu` - A drop-down menu with some commonly used resolutions.
- Use Global Res Multiplier `resmult` - Uses the Global Resolution Multiplier found in **Edit >Preferences>TOPs**. This multiplies all the TOPs resolutions by the set amount. This is handy when working on computers with different hardware specifications. If a project is designed on a desktop workstation with lots of graphics memory, a user on a laptop with only 64MB VRAM can set the Global Resolution Multiplier to a value of half or quarter so it runs at an acceptable speed. By checking this checkbox on, this TOP is affected by the global multiplier.
- Output Aspect `outputaspect` - ⊞ - Sets the image aspect ratio allowing any textures to be viewed in any size. Watch for unexpected results when compositing TOPs with different aspect ratios. (You can define images with non-square pixels using xres, yres, aspectx, aspecty where xres/yres != aspectx/aspecty.)
  * Use Input `useinput` - Uses the input's aspect ratio.
  * Resolution `resolution` - Uses the aspect of the image's defined resolution (ie 512x256 would be 2:1), whereby each pixel is square.
  * Custom Aspect `custom` - Lets you explicitly define a custom aspect ratio in the Aspect parameter below.

- Aspect `aspect` - ⊞ - Use when Output Aspect parameter is set to Custom Aspect.
  * Aspect1 `aspect1` -
  * Aspect2 `aspect2` -

- Aspect Menu `armenu` - A drop-down menu with some commonly used aspect ratios.
- Input Smoothness `inputfiltertype` - ⊞ - This controls pixel filtering on the input image of the TOP.
  * Nearest Pixel `nearest` - Uses nearest pixel or accurate image representation. Images will look jaggy when viewing at any zoom level other than Native Resolution.
  * Interpolate Pixels `linear` - Uses linear filtering between pixels. This is how you get TOP images in viewers to look good at various zoom levels, especially useful when using any Fill Viewer setting other than Native Resolution.
  * Mipmap Pixels `mipmap` - Uses [ mipmap](https://docs.derivative.ca/Mipmapping "Mipmapping") filtering when scaling images. This can be used to reduce artifacts and sparkling in moving/scaling images that have lots of detail.

- Fill Viewer `fillmode` - ⊞ - Determine how the TOP image is displayed in the viewer.
**NOTE:** To get an understanding of how TOPs work with images, you will want to set this to **Native Resolution** as you lay down TOPs when starting out. This will let you see what is actually happening without any automatic viewer resizing.

  * Fill `fill` - Stretches the image to fit the edges of the viewer.
  * Fit Horizontal `width` - Stretches image to fit viewer horizontally.
  * Fit Vertical `height` - Stretches image to fit viewer vertically.
  * Fit Best `best` - Stretches or squashes image so no part of image is cropped.
  * Fit Outside `outside` - Stretches or squashes image so image fills viewer while constraining it's proportions. This often leads to part of image getting cropped by viewer.
  * Native Resolution `nativeres` - Displays the native resolution of the image in the viewer.

- Viewer Smoothness `filtertype` - ⊞ - This controls pixel filtering in the viewers.
  * Nearest Pixel `nearest` - Uses nearest pixel or accurate image representation. Images will look jaggy when viewing at any zoom level other than Native Resolution.
  * Interpolate Pixels `linear` - Uses linear filtering between pixels. Use this to get TOP images in viewers to look good at various zoom levels, especially useful when using any Fill Viewer setting other than Native Resolution.
