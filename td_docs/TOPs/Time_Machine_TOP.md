# Time Machine TOP
## Summary

The Time Machine TOP combines pixels in a sequence of images stored in a [Texture 3D TOP](https://docs.derivative.ca/Texture_3D_TOP "Texture 3D TOP"). Whereas "morphing" warps an image "spatially" (in xy), Time Machine warps images only in time.
Time Machine, originally known as "tima" in PRISMS, was first used in 1995 for warping effects in [Ghost in the Shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghost_in_the_Shell_\(1995_film\)), a Japanese anime film that heavily used PRISMS for camera perspective effects, compositing, 3D and effects.
You must connect a Texture 3D TOP to the Time Machine's first input. It uses this array of images and displays different depths of the 3D texture.
The second input determines the time offset of the output image. The second input is expected to be monochrome, but uses the red channel when it is not monochrome. By default, where there is a black pixel in the second input, it gets the oldest layer of the 3D texture. Where there is a white pixel in the second input, it gets the most recent layer of the 3D texture. Black Offset and White Offset adjust the range of time that the black to white parts of the image are offset within. For example, if Black Offset is -10 and White Offset is 0, then a black pixel would be 10 frames behind in time, a white pixel the current frame, and a 50% grey pixel would be 5 frames behind in time (in between the Black and White Offsets).

## Parameters - TimeMachine Page
- Black Offset `blackoffset` - Sets the time offset for black areas of the Input 2 image.
- Black Offset Unit `blackoffsetunit` - Set the units for this parameter to index, frames, seconds or a fraction.
- White Offset `whiteoffset` - Sets the time offset for white areas of the Input 2 image.
- White Offset Unit `whiteoffsetunit` - Set the units for this parameter to index, frames, seconds or a fraction.

## Parameters - Common Page
- Output Resolution `outputresolution` - ⊞ - quickly change the resolution of the TOP's data.
  * Use Input `useinput` - Uses the input's resolution.
  * Eighth `eighth` - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount.
  * Quarter `quarter` - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount.
  * Half `half` - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount.
  * 2X `2x` - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount.
  * 4X `4x` - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount.
  * 8X `8x` - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount.
  * Fit Resolution `fit` - Fits the width and height to the resolution given below, while maintaining the aspect ratio.
  * Limit Resolution `limit` - The width and height are limited to the resolution given below. If one of the dimensions exceeds the given resolution, the width and height will be reduced to fit inside the given limits while maintaining the aspect ratio.
  * Custom Resolution `custom` - Enables the Resolution parameter below, giving direct control over width and height.

- Resolution `resolution` - ⊞ - Enabled only when the Resolution parameter is set to Custom Resolution. Some Generators like Constant and Ramp do not use inputs and only use this field to determine their size. The drop down menu on the right provides some commonly used resolutions.
  * W `resolutionw` -
  * H `resolutionh` -

- Resolution Menu `resmenu` - A drop-down menu with some commonly used resolutions.
- Use Global Res Multiplier `resmult` - Uses the Global Resolution Multiplier found in **Edit >Preferences>TOPs**. This multiplies all the TOPs resolutions by the set amount. This is handy when working on computers with different hardware specifications. If a project is designed on a desktop workstation with lots of graphics memory, a user on a laptop with only 64MB VRAM can set the Global Resolution Multiplier to a value of half or quarter so it runs at an acceptable speed. By checking this checkbox on, this TOP is affected by the global multiplier.
- Output Aspect `outputaspect` - ⊞ - Sets the image aspect ratio allowing any textures to be viewed in any size. Watch for unexpected results when compositing TOPs with different aspect ratios. (You can define images with non-square pixels using xres, yres, aspectx, aspecty where xres/yres != aspectx/aspecty.)
  * Use Input `useinput` - Uses the input's aspect ratio.
  * Resolution `resolution` - Uses the aspect of the image's defined resolution (ie 512x256 would be 2:1), whereby each pixel is square.
  * Custom Aspect `custom` - Lets you explicitly define a custom aspect ratio in the Aspect parameter below.

- Aspect `aspect` - ⊞ - Use when Output Aspect parameter is set to Custom Aspect.
  * Aspect1 `aspect1` -
  * Aspect2 `aspect2` -

- Aspect Menu `armenu` - A drop-down menu with some commonly used aspect ratios.
- Input Smoothness `inputfiltertype` - ⊞ - This controls pixel filtering on the input image of the TOP.
  * Nearest Pixel `nearest` - Uses nearest pixel or accurate image representation. Images will look jaggy when viewing at any zoom level other than Native Resolution.
  * Interpolate Pixels `linear` - Uses linear filtering between pixels. This is how you get TOP images in viewers to look good at various zoom levels, especially useful when using any Fill Viewer setting other than Native Resolution.
  * Mipmap Pixels `mipmap` - Uses [ mipmap](https://docs.derivative.ca/Mipmapping "Mipmapping") filtering when scaling images. This can be used to reduce artifacts and sparkling in moving/scaling images that have lots of detail.

- Fill Viewer `fillmode` - ⊞ - Determine how the TOP image is displayed in the viewer.
**NOTE:** To get an understanding of how TOPs work with images, you will want to set this to **Native Resolution** as you lay down TOPs when starting out. This will let you see what is actually happening without any automatic viewer resizing.
  * Use Input `useinput` - Uses the same Fill Viewer settings as it's input.
  * Fill `fill` - Stretches the image to fit the edges of the viewer.
  * Fit Horizontal `width` - Stretches image to fit viewer horizontally.
  * Fit Vertical `height` - Stretches image to fit viewer vertically.
  * Fit Best `best` - Stretches or squashes image so no part of image is cropped.
  * Fit Outside `outside` - Stretches or squashes image so image fills viewer while constraining it's proportions. This often leads to part of image getting cropped by viewer.
  * Native Resolution `nativeres` - Displays the native resolution of the image in the viewer.

- Viewer Smoothness `filtertype` - ⊞ - This controls pixel filtering in the viewers.
  * Nearest Pixel `nearest` - Uses nearest pixel or accurate image representation. Images will look jaggy when viewing at any zoom level other than Native Resolution.
  * Interpolate Pixels `linear` - Uses linear filtering between pixels. Use this to get TOP images in viewers to look good at various zoom levels, especially useful when using any Fill Viewer setting other than Native Resolution.
  * Mipmap Pixels `mipmap` - Uses [ mipmap](https://docs.derivative.ca/Mipmapping "Mipmapping") filtering when scaling images. This can be used to reduce artifacts and sparkling in moving/scaling images that have lots of detail.

- Passes `npasses` - Duplicates the operation of the TOP the specified number of times. Making this larger than 1 is essentially the same as taking the output from each pass, and passing it into the first input of the node and repeating the process. Other inputs and parameters remain the same for each pass.
- Channel Mask `chanmask` - Allows you to choose which channels (R, G, B, or A) the TOP will operate on. All channels are selected by default.
- Pixel Format `format` - ⊞ - Format used to store data for each channel in the image (ie. R, G, B, and A). Refer to [Pixel Formats](https://docs.derivative.ca/Pixel_Formats "Pixel Formats") for more information.

The Alpha channel in this format will always be 1. Values can go above one, but can't be negative. ie. the range is [0, infinite).
  * 16-bit float (RGB) `rgb16float` -
  * 32-bit float (RGB) `rgb32float` -
