# Cache TOP
## Summary

The Cache TOP stores a sequence of images into GPU memory. These cached images can be read by the graphics card much faster than an image cache in main memory or reading images off disk.
The Cache TOP can be used to freeze images in the TOP by turning the Active parameter Off. (You can set the cache size too `1`.)
The Cache TOP acts as a delay if you set Output Index to negative numbers and leave the Active parameter On.
Once a sequence of images has been captured by turning the Active parameter On or toggling the Active Pulse parameter, they can be looped by animating the Output Index parameter.
[cacheTOP_Class](https://docs.derivative.ca/CacheTOP_Class "CacheTOP Class")

## Parameters - Cache Page
- Active `active` - While this is On, the Cache TOP will capture images into its memory.
- Active Pulse `activepulse` - Captures an image for the single frame this was pulsed.
- Get One Image on Startup `cacheonce` - Checking this On will cook the TOP once after startup to load an initial image.
- Replace Single `replace` - While this is On, the Cache TOP will replace the image at 'Replace Index' with the input image. This allows you to replace specific images in the cache at will.
- Replace Pulse `replacespulse` - Replace an image for the single frame this was pulsed.
- Replace Index `replaceindex` - Select the image index that will be replaced by the input, when 'Replace Single' is turned on.
- Pre-Fill `prefill` - Cooks 'Cache Size' number of times to fill the Cache TOP with images. When set to 1, it will fill the cache. If set to 1 during playback, it will fill immediately. If set to 1 and saved out, then next time the file is opened the cache will pre-fill. While this is > 0, the node behaves as if the Active parameter is Off. If set to 0, then back > 0, it will clear the previous data, and pre-fill again. For more information refer to the [Pre-Filling](https://docs.derivative.ca/Pre-Filling "Pre-Filling") article.
- Pre-Fill Pulse `prefillpulse` - Pre-fills a single image during the frame this was pulsed.
- Cache Size `cachesize` - Determines the number of images that can be stored in this Cache TOP.
- Step Size `step` - The number of cooks that go by before the Cache TOP grabs an image. A Step Size of 2 will cache an image every 2nd cook, a Step Size of 3 will cache every 3rd cook, and so on.
- Output Index `outputindex` - Determines which image in cache the TOP outputs. 0 is the most recent image, negative integers output image further back in time.
- Output Index Unit `outputindexunit` - Sets the units used in the Output Index parameter.
- Interpolate Frames `interp` - When On (On = 1), the Cache TOP will interpolate between frames when non-integer values are used in the Output Index parameter. For example, a value of -0.5 in Output Index will output a blended image of the most recent frame (0.0) and the second most recent frame (-1.0).
- Always Cook `alwayscook` - Forces the operator to cook every frame.
- Reset `reset` - While On this will empty the cache of stored images and release the memory held by the TOP.
- Reset `resetpulse` - Instantly empty the cache.

## Parameters - Common Page
- Output Resolution `outputresolution` - ⊞ - quickly change the resolution of the TOP's data.
  * Use Input `useinput` - Uses the input's resolution.
  * Eighth `eighth` - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount.
  * Quarter `quarter` - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount.
  * Half `half` - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount.
  * 2X `2x` - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount.
  * 4X `4x` - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount.
  * 8X `8x` - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount.
  * Fit Resolution `fit` - Fits the width and height to the resolution given below, while maintaining the aspect ratio.
  * Limit Resolution `limit` - The width and height are limited to the resolution given below. If one of the dimensions exceeds the given resolution, the width and height will be reduced to fit inside the given limits while maintaining the aspect ratio.
  * Custom Resolution `custom` - Enables the Resolution parameter below, giving direct control over width and height.

- Resolution `resolution` - ⊞ - Enabled only when the Resolution parameter is set to Custom Resolution. Some Generators like Constant and Ramp do not use inputs and only use this field to determine their size. The drop down menu on the right provides some commonly used resolutions.
  * W `resolutionw` -
  * H `resolutionh` -

- Resolution Menu `resmenu` - A drop-down menu with some commonly used resolutions.
- Use Global Res Multiplier `resmult` - Uses the Global Resolution Multiplier found in **Edit >Preferences>TOPs**. This multiplies all the TOPs resolutions by the set amount. This is handy when working on computers with different hardware specifications. If a project is designed on a desktop workstation with lots of graphics memory, a user on a laptop with only 64MB VRAM can set the Global Resolution Multiplier to a value of half or quarter so it runs at an acceptable speed. By checking this checkbox on, this TOP is affected by the global multiplier.
- Output Aspect `outputaspect` - ⊞ - Sets the image aspect ratio allowing any textures to be viewed in any size. Watch for unexpected results when compositing TOPs with different aspect ratios. (You can define images with non-square pixels using xres, yres, aspectx, aspecty where xres/yres != aspectx/aspecty.)
  * Use Input `useinput` - Uses the input's aspect ratio.
  * Resolution `resolution` - Uses the aspect of the image's defined resolution (ie 512x256 would be 2:1), whereby each pixel is square.
  * Custom Aspect `custom` - Lets you explicitly define a custom aspect ratio in the Aspect parameter below.

- Aspect `aspect` - ⊞ - Use when Output Aspect parameter is set to Custom Aspect.
  * Aspect1 `aspect1` -
  * Aspect2 `aspect2` -

- Aspect Menu `armenu` - A drop-down menu with some commonly used aspect ratios.
- Input Smoothness `inputfiltertype` - ⊞ - This controls pixel filtering on the input image of the TOP.
  * Nearest Pixel `nearest` - Uses nearest pixel or accurate image representation. Images will look jaggy when viewing at any zoom level other than Native Resolution.
  * Interpolate Pixels `linear` - Uses linear filtering between pixels. This is how you get TOP images in viewers to look good at various zoom levels, especially useful when using any Fill Viewer setting other than Native Resolution.
  * Mipmap Pixels `mipmap` - Uses [ mipmap](https://docs.derivative.ca/Mipmapping "Mipmapping") filtering when scaling images. This can be used to reduce artifacts and sparkling in moving/scaling images that have lots of detail.

- Fill Viewer `fillmode` - ⊞ - Determine how the TOP image is displayed in the viewer.
**NOTE:** To get an understanding of how TOPs work with images, you will want to set this to **Native Resolution** as you lay down TOPs when starting out. This will let you see what is actually happening without any automatic viewer resizing.
  * Use Input `useinput` - Uses the same Fill Viewer settings as it's input.
  * Fill `fill` - Stretches the image to fit the edges of the viewer.
  * Fit Horizontal `width` - Stretches image to fit viewer horizontally.
  * Fit Vertical `height` - Stretches image to fit viewer vertically.
  * Fit Best `best` - Stretches or squashes image so no part of image is cropped.
  * Fit Outside `outside` - Stretches or squashes image so image fills viewer while constraining it's proportions. This often leads to part of image getting cropped by viewer.
  * Native Resolution `nativeres` - Displays the native resolution of the image in the viewer.

- Viewer Smoothness `filtertype` - ⊞ - This controls pixel filtering in the viewers.
  * Nearest Pixel `nearest` - Uses nearest pixel or accurate image representation. Images will look jaggy when viewing at any zoom level other than Native Resolution.
  * Interpolate Pixels `linear` - Uses linear filtering between pixels. Use this to get TOP images in viewers to look good at various zoom levels, especially useful when using any Fill Viewer setting other than Native Resolution.
  * Mipmap Pixels `mipmap` - Uses [ mipmap](https://docs.derivative.ca/Mipmapping "Mipmapping") filtering when scaling images. This can be used to reduce artifacts and sparkling in moving/scaling images that have lots of detail.

- Passes `npasses` - Duplicates the operation of the TOP the specified number of times. Making this larger than 1 is essentially the same as taking the output from each pass, and passing it into the first input of the node and repeating the process. Other inputs and parameters remain the same for each pass.
