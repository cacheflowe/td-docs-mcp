# opviewerCOMP Class

This class inherits from the [ COMP class](https://docs.derivative.ca/COMP_Class "COMP Class"). It references a specific [OP Viewer COMP](https://docs.derivative.ca/OP_Viewer_COMP "OP Viewer COMP").


## Members
## Methods
`isViewable(path)`→ `bool`:
Returns true if this operator can view the specified operator without recursion issues."
  * path - Path to the specfied operator. An operator can be supplied as well.

#  PanelCOMP Class
## Members
`panel` → `td.Panel` **(Read Only)** :
The [Panel](https://docs.derivative.ca/Panel_Class "Panel Class") from which [Panel Values](https://docs.derivative.ca/Panel_Value "Panel Value") and the [PanelValue Class](https://docs.derivative.ca/PanelValue_Class "PanelValue Class") may be accessed. (The second form is usually sufficient.)

```
v = op('button1').panel.u.val
v = op('button1').panel.u

```

`panelRoot` → `OP` **(Read Only)** :
The panelCOMP at the top of the panel hierarchy.

`panelChildren` → `list` **(Read Only)** :
The children panelCOMPs of this operator.

`x` → `int` **(Read Only)** :
The panel's x coordinate, as measured in pixels.

`y` → `int` **(Read Only)** :
The panel's y coordinate, as measured in pixels.

`width` → `int` **(Read Only)** :
The panel's width, as measured in pixels.

`height` → `int` **(Read Only)** :
The panel's height, as measured in pixels.

`marginX` → `int` **(Read Only)** :
The panel's x coordinate adjusted by margins as measured in pixels.

`marginY` → `int` **(Read Only)** :
The panel's y coordinate adjusted by margins, as measured in pixels.

`marginWidth` → `int` **(Read Only)** :
The panel's width adjusted by margins, as measured in pixels.

`marginHeight` → `int` **(Read Only)** :
The panel's height adjusted by margins, as measured in pixels.

`dropReady` → `bool` **(Read Only)** :
The current state of the drop operation. True when the drop will be accepted.
## Methods
`panelParent(n)`→ `OP | None`:
The nth panel parent of this operator. If n not specified, returns the panel parent. If n = 2, returns the parent of the parent, etc. If no panel parent exists at that level, None is returned. A panel parent is the panel wired to the input of this operator, or if that does not exist, the panel containing this operator.
  * n - (Optional) n is the number of levels up to climb. When n = 1 it will return the operator's panel parent.

```
p = me.panelParent(2) #grandfather

```

`interactMouse(u, v, leftClick=0, middleClick=0, rightClick=0, left=False, middle=False, right=False, wheel=0, pixels=False, Screen=False, quiet=True)`→ `PanelCOMP`:
Simulates virtual mouse clicks, rollovers, moves and drags on a panel. It will also update the panel values: inside, insideu, insidev, state, u and v, in panels all the way up to the parent panel. The first (primary) mouse down/touch on a panel takes precedence over subsequent mouse downs and touches, and overrides any hovers. The primary state on a panel is global as each panel can only have one interaction updating its state.
  * u - The first coordinate for the click to occur at.
  * v - The second coordinate for the click to occur at.
  * leftClick, middleClick, rightClick - (Keyword, Optional) Use to specify the number of times a button is clicked on
  * left, middle, right - (Keyword, Optional) Use to specify if the button is being pressed. When set to False it simulates a mouse move with the button up. The first time the button is set to True will initiate a virtual mouse down on the child panel at the coordinates u,v. Subsequent True states will simulate a drag (mouse button down and moving). Simulate a mouse-up by calling the button set to False, e.g. left=False.
  * wheel - (Keyword, Optional) Roll the mouse wheel
  * pixels - (Keyword, Optional) When True, the coordinates are treated as pixel offsets. When False, they are treated as normalized values.
  * screen - (Keyword, Optional) When True, the coordinates are relative to the screen. When False, they are relative to the calling container.
  * quiet - (Keyword, Optional) When False, print warning messages, such as starting a mouse-down-move on a panel that is already being moved (dragged).
  * aux - (Keyword, Optional) Auxiliary data.

```
op('container1').interactMouse(0.5, 0.5) # roll over the middle of container1
op('container1').interactMouse(0.5, 0.5, leftClick=2) # double click the middle of container1
op('container1').interactMouse(0.5, 0.5, left=True) # left mouse down on the middle of container1
op('container1').interactMouse(0.6, 0.6, left=True) # move with left mouse down in container1
op('container1').interactMouse(0.6, 0.6) # mouse up
op('container1').interactMouse(0.5, 0.5, wheel=0.3) # roll the mouse wheel in the middle of container1
op('container1').interactMouse(10, 20, pixels=True) # send a mouse event 10 pixels to the right, and 20 pixels above the lower left corner of container1

```

`interactTouch(u, v, hover='id', start='id', move='id', end='id', pixels=False, screen=False, quiet=True, aux='data')`→ `PanelCOMP`:
Simulates virtual multiple touches and hovers on a panel via user assigned id. It will also update the panel values: inside, insideu, insidev, state, u and v, in panels all the way up to the parent panel. The first (primary) mouse down/touch on a panel takes precedence over subsequent mouse downs and touches, and overrides any hovers. The primary state on a panel is global.
  * u - The first coordinate for the click to occur at.
  * v - The second coordinate for the click to occur at.
  * hover - (Keyword, Optional) Indicates a hover performed by the touch identifiable by 'id'. If 'id' is used by a touch, the touch is ended. If the <u,v> is out of bounds, the hover will end.
  * start - (Keyword, Optional) Start a touch identifiable by 'id'. If 'id' is already touching or hovering, the action is ended and a new touch is started.
  * move - (Keyword, Optional) Move a touch identifiable by 'id'. Nothing happens if 'id' is not found.
  * end - (Keyword, Optional) End a touch identifiable by 'id'. Nothing happens if 'id' is not found.
  * pixels - (Keyword, Optional) When True, the coordinates are treated as pixel offsets. When False, they are treated as normalized values.
  * screen - (Keyword, Optional) When True, the coordinates are relative to the screen. When False, they are relative to the calling container.
  * quiet - (Keyword, Optional) Print warning messages, such as starting a touch down on a panel that already has a touch.

```
op('container1').interactTouch(0.5, 0.5, hover='finger') # roll over the middle of container1
op('container1').interactTouch(0.5, 0.5, start='finger') # ends the hover and start a touch
op('container1').interactTouch(0.7, 0.5, move='finger') # move the touch
op('container1').interactTouch(0.3, 0.4, start='finger') # ends the previous touch and start a new touch
op('container1').interactTouch(-1, -1, hover='finger') # ends the previous touch, and end any rollover state

```

`interactClear()`→ `None`:
Terminates any existing interactions. Touch or mouse interactions will end. Panels that are hovered over will end their rollover state.

`interactStatus()`→ `list`:
Returns a list of panel interactions. Each interaction is encapsulated in a list as follows: [id, panel, state, primary].
  * id - The unique string identifying the interaction. '__MOUSE__' is used if the interaction was established via interactMouse.
  * panel - The child panel being interacted with .
  * state - Interaction types 'hover' or 'touch'.
  * primary - True if the interaction is the first to act on the panel.

```
op('container1').interactStatus  # list the current hover over a slider and 2 touches over a button in container1
[['touch1', type:sliderCOMP path:/project1/container1/slider1, 'hover', False],
['__MOUSE__', type:buttonCOMP path:/project1/container1/button1, 'touch', True],
['touch2', type:buttonCOMP path:/project1/container1/button1, 'touch', False]]

```

`progressiveUnload(totalFrames=None, timePerFrame=None, nodesPerFrame=None, gpuMemPerFrame=None, opsToExclude=None)`→ `None`:
This method allows you to try to release the CPU and GPU memory allocated for the child nodes of this component, with the unloading staggered over several frames. For each unloaded node, the memory will get reallocated next time the node cooks, so make sure nothing is still using it to keep it released.
The `cacheMemory` option that `unload()` has for the Movie File In TOP is not available in `progressiveUnload()`. Hence, all memory for the Movie File In TOP is released. See also [OP](https://docs.derivative.ca/OP_Class "OP Class") method `unload()`.
The component's `progressiveUnloader` [ member](https://docs.derivative.ca/ProgressiveUnloader_Class "ProgressiveUnloader Class") contains status info regarding the latest unload operation, and has methods for modifying the unload operation such as `kill()` which terminates the unloading.
If no arguments are provided then everything is unloaded in a single frame.
All PerFrame options can be specified together. Unloading will move to next frame when one of the criteria gets met.
  * totalFrames - (Keyword, Optional) Maximum number of frames to unload over. Other options cannot be used with this one.
  * timePerFrame - (Keyword, Optional) Time to be spent unloading each frame. Specified in milliseconds. Nodes continually get unloaded that frame until the total time spent unloading is equal to or greater than this value. Hence the final frame unload time can be greater than this value.
  * nodesPerFrame - (Keyword, Optional) Total nodes to unload each frame.
  * gpuMemPerFrame - (Keyword, Optional) GPU memory to unload each frame. Specified in MB. Nodes continually get unloaded that frame until the total GPU memory unloaded is equal to or greater than this value. Hence the final GPU mem unloaded can be greater than this value.
  * opsToExclude: (Keyword, Optional): Specify a list of OPs that should not get unloaded. If a COMP is specified in the list to be excluded, all its internal OPs are also excluded.

```
#Progressively unload the COMP over the next 10 frames
n.progressiveUnload(totalFrames=10)

#Progressively unload the COMP by unloading 5 nodes each frame
n.progressiveUnload(nodesPerFrame=5)

#Unload the COMP each frame until the time spent unloading is atleast 16ms
n.progressiveUnload(timePerFrame=16)

#Unload the COMP each frame until atleast one of the specified criteria is hit
n.progressiveUnload(gpuMemPerFrame=15, timePerFrame=16)

## Methods
###  General
**NOTE** : `create()`, `copy()` and `copyOPs()` is done by the parent operator (a component). For more information see [COMP.create, COMP.copy and COMP.copyOPs methods](https://docs.derivative.ca/COMP_Class#Methods "COMP Class").


`pars(pattern)`→ `list[Par]`:
Returns a (possibly empty) list of [parameter objects](https://docs.derivative.ca/Par_Class "Par Class") that match the pattern.
  * pattern - Is a string following the [Pattern Matching](https://docs.derivative.ca/Pattern_Matching "Pattern Matching") rules, specifying which parameters to return.

```
newlist = op('geo1').pars('t?', 'r?', 's?') #translate/rotate/scale parameters

```

Note: If searching for a single parameter given a name, it's much more efficient to use the subscript operator. For example:

```
name = 'MyName1'
op('geo1').par[name]

```

`parGroups(pattern)`→ `list[Par]`:
Returns a (possibly empty) list of [parGroup objects](https://docs.derivative.ca/ParGroup_Class "ParGroup Class") that match the pattern.
  * pattern - Is a string following the [Pattern Matching](https://docs.derivative.ca/Pattern_Matching "Pattern Matching") rules, specifying which parameters to return.

```
debug(op('geo1').parGroups('p*'))

```

**Note:** If searching for a single ParGroup given a name, it's much more efficient to use the subscript operator. For example:

```
name = 'MyColor'
op('geo1').parGroup[name]

```

or even:

```
op('geo1').parGroup.MyColor

```

`ops(*patterns, includeUtility=False)`→ `List[OP]`:
Returns a (possibly empty) list of OPs that match the patterns, relative to the inside of this OP.

  * `pattern` - Can be string following the [Pattern Matching](https://docs.derivative.ca/Pattern_Matching "Pattern Matching") rules, specifying which OPs to return, or an integer, which must be an OP Id. Multiple patterns can be given and all matched OPs will be returned.
  * `includeUtility` - (Keyword, Optional) If specified, controls whether or not utility components (eg Comments) are included in the results.

**Note:** a version of this method that searches relative to '/' is also in the global [td module](https://docs.derivative.ca/Td_Module "Td Module").

```
newlist = n.ops('arm*', 'leg*', 'leg5/foot*')

```

`cook(force=False, recurse=False, includeUtility=False)`→ `None`:

```
op('geo1').copyParameters( op('geo2') )

```

`changeType(OPtype)`→ `OP`:
Change referenced operator to a new operator type. After this call, this OP object should no longer be referenced. Instead use the returned OP object.
  * OPtype - The python class name of the operator type you want to change this operator to. This is not a string, but instead is a class defined in the global [td module](https://docs.derivative.ca/Td_Module "Td Module").

```
n = op('wave1').changeType(nullCHOP) #changes 'wave1' into a Null CHOP
n = op('text1').changeType(tcpipDAT) #changes 'text1' operator into a TCPIP DAT

```

`dependenciesTo(OP)`→ `list`:
Returns a (possibly empty) list of operator dependency paths between this operator and the specified operator. Multiple paths may be found.

`evalExpression(str)`→ `Any`:
Evaluate the expression from the context of this OP. Can be used to evaluate arbitrary snippets of code from arbitrary locations.
  * str - The expression to evaluate.

```
op('wave1').evalExpression('me.digits')  #returns 1

```

If the expression already resides in a parameter, use that parameters [evalExpression()](https://docs.derivative.ca/Par_Class "Par Class") method instead.

`destroy()`→ `None`:
Destroy the operator referenced by this OP. An exception will be raised if the OP's operator has already been destroyed.

`var(name, search=True)`→ `str`:
Evaluate a[ variable](https://docs.derivative.ca/Variables "Variables"). This will return the empty string, if not found. Most information obtained from variables (except for Root and Component variables) are accessible through other means in Python, usually in the global [td module](https://docs.derivative.ca/Td_Module "Td Module").
  * name - The variable name to search for.
  * search - (Keyword, Optional) If set to True (which is default) the operator hierarchy is searched until a variable matching that name is found. If false, the search is constrained to the operator.

`openMenu(x=None, y=None)`→ `None`:
Open a node menu for the operator at x, y. Opens at mouse if x & y are not specified.

  * includeCustom (Keyword, Optional) - Include custom parameters.

```
op('player').resetPars(includeBuiltin=False) # only reset custom

```

`unload(cacheMemory=False)`→ `None`:
Unloads CPU and GPU for the node. The memory will be realloted next time the node cooks, so make sure nothing is still using it to keep it released.
  * cacheMemory - (Keyword, Optional) Currently only supported by the [Movie File In TOP](https://docs.derivative.ca/Movie_File_In_TOP "Movie File In TOP"). If you are preloading into a Movie File In TOP that already has video, and the video format/resolution is the same, you can use the cacheMemory option to first unload the original movie and cache its memory, avoiding a reallocation when the `preload()` occurs. If True the memory (textures, upload buffers) of the movie will be cached for use by another movie later on. Useful if you are opening/closing many movies with the same codec and resolution.>

  * borders - (Keyword, Optional) If true, the floating window containing the viewer will have borders.

```
op('geo1').openViewer(unique=True, borders=False) # opens a new borderless viewer window for 'geo1'

```

`resetViewer(recurse=False)`→ `None`:
Reset the OP content viewer to default view settings.

```

`openParameters()`→ `None`:
Open a floating dialog containing the operator parameters.
###  Storage
[Storage](https://docs.derivative.ca/Storage "Storage") can be used to keep data within components. Storage is implemented as one python dictionary per node.
When an element of storage is changed by using `n.store()` as explained below, expressions and operators that depend on it will automatically re-cook. It is retrieved with the `n.fetch()` function.
Storage is saved in `.toe` and `.tox` files and restored on startup.
Storage can hold any python object type (not just strings as in Tscript variables). Storage elements can also have optional startup values, specified separately. Use these startup values for example, to avoid saving and loading some session specific object, and instead save or load a well defined object like `None`.
See the [Examine DAT](https://docs.derivative.ca/Examine_DAT "Examine DAT") for procedurally viewing the contents of storage.


`fetch(key, default, search=True, storeDefault=False)`→ `Any`:
Return an object from the OP storage dictionary. If the item is not found, and a default it supplied, it will be returned instead.
  * key - The name of the entry to retrieve.
  * default - (Optional) If provided and no item is found then the passed value/object is returned instead.
  * storeDefault - (Keyword, Optional) If True, and the key is not found, the default is stored as well.
  * search - (Keyword, Optional) If True, the parent of each OP is searched recursively until a match is found

```
v = n.fetch('sales5', 0.0)

```

`fetchOwner(key)`→ `OP`:
Return the operator which contains the stored key, or None if not found.
  * key - The key to the stored entry you are looking for.

```
who = n.fetchOwner('sales5') #find the OP that has a storage entry called 'sales5'

```

`store(key, value)`→ `Any`:
Add the key/value pair to the OP's storage dictionary, or replace it if it already exists. If this value is not intended to be saved and loaded in the toe file, it can be be given an alternate value for saving and loading, by using the method storeStartupValue described below.
  * key - A string name for the storage entry. Use this name to retrieve the value using fetch().
  * value - The value/object to store.

```
n.store('sales5', 34.5) # stores a floating point value 34.5.
n.store('moviebank', op('/project1/movies')) # stores an OP for easy access later on.

```

`unstore(*keys)`→ `None`:
For each key, remove it from the OP's storage dictionary. Pattern Matching is supported as well.
  * keys - The name or pattern defining which key/value pairs to remove from the storage dictionary.

```
n.unstore('sales*') # removes all entries from this OPs storage that start with 'sales'

```

`storeStartupValue(key, value)`→ `None`:
Add the key/value pair to the OP's storage startup dictionary. The storage element will take on this value when the file starts up.
  * key - A string name for the storage startup entry.
  * value - The startup value/object to store.

```
n.storeStartupValue('sales5', 1) # 'sales5' will have a value of 1 when the file starts up.

```

`unstoreStartupValue(*keys)`→ `None`:
For key, remove it from the OP's storage startup dictionary. Pattern Matching is supported as well. This does not affect the stored value, just its startup value.
  * keys - The name or pattern defining which key/value pairs to remove from the storage startup dictionary.

```
n.unstoreStartupValue('sales*') # removes all entries from this OPs storage startup that start with 'sales'

```

###  Miscellaneous
`__getstate__()`→ `dict`:
Returns a dictionary with persistent data about the object suitable for pickling and deep copies.

`__setstate__()`→ `dict`:
Reads the dictionary to update persistent details about the object, suitable for unpickling and deep copies.
