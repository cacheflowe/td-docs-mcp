# Field COMP
## Summary

**Note** : Field COMP deprecated build 2022.24200, use [Text COMP](https://docs.derivative.ca/Text_COMP "Text COMP").
The Field Component lets you enter text strings and renders text generated with the [Text TOP](https://docs.derivative.ca/Text_TOP "Text TOP"). Internally it contains a Text TOP which points to one cell of a DAT that contains the text to render. The Field COMP modifies the DAT cell as text is entered.

## Parameters - Layout Page
The Layout parameter page controls the size and position of the panel.
- X `x` - Specify the horizontal position in pixels relative to its parent.
- Y `y` - Specify the vertical position in pixels relative to its parent.
- Width `w` - Specify the panel's width in pixels.
- Height `h` - Specify the Panel's height in pixels.
- Fixed Aspect `fixedaspect` - ⊞ - Allows easy creation of panels with a specific aspect set in the Aspect Ratio parameter below. Only requires setting the width or height of the panel and the other dimension is calculated based on the Aspect Ratio parameter.
  * Off `off` -
  * Use Horizontal `horizontal` -
  * Use Vertical `vertical` -

- Aspect Ratio `aspect` - Specify the ratio when using Fixed Aspect parameter above, the ratio is width/height.
- Depth Layer `layer` - Specifies the order the panel components are drawn in, similar to layers in Photoshop. Higher values will be drawn over any other panel with a lower value (that is at the same level of hierarchy). If two panel components have the same Depth Layer value then they are ordered based on the operator's name.
- Horizontal Mode `hmode` - ⊞ - Select one of 3 modes to determine the horizontal width of the panel.
  * Fixed Width `fixed` - Uses the Width parameter above to set this panel's width in pixels.
  * Fill `fill` - The width of this panel will match (fill) the width of the parent panel.
  * Anchors `anchors` - The width of this panel is set by the Left Anchor and Right Anchor parameters below which will maintain a relative width to the parent panel as the parent panel changes size. This allows for stretchy panels. These anchor parameters are normalized 0-1 like uv coordinates where 0 is the left edge and 1 is the right edge of the parent panel. For example, Left Anchor = 0.2 and Right Anchor = 0.8 will maintain the width proportionally to the parent panel such that the left edge is 20% (0.2) in from the left and the right edge is 20% (0.8) in from the right.

- Left Anchor `leftanchor` - Position of the left anchor of the panel with respect to the parent. This value is normalized 0-1, 0 is the left edge of the parent and 1 is the right edge of the parent.
- Left Offset `leftoffset` - An offset for the left anchor in pixels.
- Right Anchor `rightanchor` - Position of the right anchor of the panel with respect to the parent. This value is normalized 0-1, 0 is the left edge of the parent and 1 is the right edge of the parent.
- Right Offset `rightoffset` - An offset for the right anchor in pixels.
- Horizontal Origin `horigin` - Sets the position of the panel's origin horizontally. The default origin (0,0) is the bottom-left corner of the panel.
- Horizontal Fill Weight `hfillweight` - When multiple panels are using Horizontal Mode = Fill and being aligned by the parent either Left to Right or Right to Left, this fill weight parameter can be used to bias the fill width of the panels.
- Vertical Mode `vmode` - ⊞ - Select one of 3 modes to determine the vertical height of the panel.
  * Fixed Height `fixed` - Uses the Height parameter above to set this panel's height in pixels.
  * Fill `fill` - The height of this panel will match (fill) the height of the parent panel.
  * Anchors `anchors` - The height of this panel is set by the Bottom Anchor and Top Anchor parameters below which will maintain a relative and proportionally height to the parent panel as the parent panel changes size. This allows for stretchy panels. These anchor parameters are normalized 0-1 like uv coordinates where 0 is the bottom edge and 1 is the top edge of the parent panel. For example, Bottom Anchor = 0.3 and Right Anchor = 0.5 will maintain the height proportionally to the parent panel such that the bottom edge is 30% (0.3) up from the bottom and the top edge is 50% (0.5) down from the top.

- Bottom Anchor `bottomanchor` - Position of the bottom anchor of the panel with respect to the parent. This value is normalized 0-1, 0 is the bottom edge of the parent and 1 is the top edge of the parent.
- Bottom Offset `bottomoffset` - An offset for the bottom anchor in pixels.
- Top Anchor `topanchor` - Position of the top anchor of the panel with respect to the parent. This value is normalized 0-1, 0 is the bottom edge of the parent and 1 is the top edge of the parent.
- Top Offset `topoffset` - An offset for the top anchor in pixels.
- Vertical Origin `vorigin` - Sets the position of the panel's origin vertically. The default origin (0,0) is the bottom-left corner of the panel.
- Vertical Fill Weight `vfillweight` - When multiple panels are using Vertical Mode = Fill and being aligned by the parent either Top to Bottom or Bottom to Top, this fill weight parameter can be used to bias the fill height of the panels.
- Parent Alignment `alignallow` - ⊞ - When set to Ignore, the Panel will ignore any Align parameter settings from its parent.
  * Allow `allow` - Aligns the panel based on settings in parent.
  * Ignore `ignore` - Does not align the panel but respects margins.
  * Ignore and Ignore Margins `ignoremargin` - Does not align the panel and disregards margins.

- Align Order `alignorder` - This parameter allows you to specify the align position when its parent's Align parameter is set to something other then **None** or **Match Network Nodes**. Lower numbers are first.
- Post Offset `postoffset` - ⊞ - Adds an offset after all other postions and alignment options have been applied to the panel.
  * X `postoffsetx` -
  * Y `postoffsety` -

- Size from Window `sizefromwindow` - When enabled the panel component's width and height are set by resizing its floating viewer window.

## Parameters - Drag/Drop Page
Please refer to [Drag-and-Drop](https://docs.derivative.ca/Drag-and-Drop "Drag-and-Drop") for a full explanation on how Drag and Drop between Panel Components functions.
- When Dragging This `drag` - ⊞ - Specify if this Panel Component can be dragged.
  * Use Parent's Drag Settings `dragparent` - Follow the parent Panel Components Drag setting.
  * Legacy Drag System `legacy` - Allow Dragging for this Panel Component. Use the Paramters `Drag Script`, `Drop Destination Script` and `Dropped Operator` to control the behaviour. 'Use Drag/Drop Callbacks' is a more powerful updated workflow.
  * Do Not Allow Drag `dragno` - Disallows Dragging for this Panel Component.
  * Use Drag/Drop Callbacks `usecallbacks` - Specify the behavior exactly with custom scripts specified below.

- Drag Script `dragscript` - Specify a script that will be executed when starting to drag a Panel Component. Please refer to the Drag Script section of the [Drag and Drop](https://docs.derivative.ca/Drag-and-Drop#Drag_Scripts "Drag-and-Drop") page.
- Drop Types `droptypescript` - If a drop destination script is specified, you can also add a DAT table with a list of return types that the drop destination script will provide. Return types can be one of the op types (COMP,TOP,CHOP,SOP,MAT,DAT), channel, or supported filetypes. Please refer to the Drop Types section of the [Drag and Drop](https://docs.derivative.ca/Drag-and-Drop#Drop_Types "Drag-and-Drop") page.
- Drop Destination Script `dropdestscript` - Specify a script that will be executed when the dragged Panel Component is dropped. A temporary network is created and the component (or the alternative operator specified in Dropped Component) is copied to this network. You can add or modify operators in this network. Please refer to the Drop Destination Script section of the [Drag and Drop](https://docs.derivative.ca/Drag-and-Drop#Drop_Destination_Scripts "Drag-and-Drop") page.
- Dropped Operator `paneldragop` - The Dropped Component parameter is the easiest way to specify an alternative operator to drop. Note that this alternative operator must exist, otherwise the component itself will be dropped. The alternative is only used when dropping onto a network or control panel. Text pasted via dragging and dropping, or files saved via dropping onto the desktop, will still use the original.
- On Dropping Into `drop` - ⊞ - Specify if this Panel Component accepts items that are dropped onto it.
  * Use Parent's Drop Settings `dropparent` - Follow the parent Panel Components Drop setting.
  * Legacy Drop System `legacy` - Allow Dropping onto this Panel Component. Use the Paramter `Drop Script` to control the behaviour. 'Use Drag/Drop Callbacks' is a more powerful updated workflow.
  * Do Not Allow Drop `dropno` - Disallows Dropping onto this Panel Component.
  * Use Drag/Drop Callbacks `usecallbacks` - Specify the behavior exactly with custom scripts specified below.
  * Fill Custom Parameter `fillparm` - Avoid any scripting and just fill in the custom parameter with the path to the dropped node.

- Built-In Drop Options `builtindrop` - Normally, when dropping over a node, if the viewer is not active, built-in drop options are provided, otherwise custom defined drop options are provided. When this option is off, custom defined drop options are used exclusively in both cases.
- Drop Script `dropscript` - A component's Drop Script is run when you drop another component or an external file into that component. Please refer to the Drop Scripts - Text section of the [Drag and Drop](https://docs.derivative.ca/Drag-and-Drop#Drop_Scripts_-_Text "Drag-and-Drop") page.
Alternatively specify a Table DAT in the drop script field. TouchDesigner will automatically look for 2 columns in the table. The first column should indicate the data type and the second should indicate the Text DAT that holds the script to process that data type. Please refer to the Drop Script - Tables section of the [Drag and Drop](https://docs.derivative.ca/Drag-and-Drop#Drop_Script_-_Tables "Drag-and-Drop") page.
- Drop Parameter `dropparm` - When 'On Dropping Into' is set to _Fill Custom Parameter_ this specifies which parameter to fill. This option together with turning off 'Built-In Drop Options' allows quickly dropping any node onto this viewer and filling a custom parameter with that dropped path.
- Drag/Drop Callbacks `dragdropcallbacks` - Specify which DAT holds the custom drag/drop scripts. If blank, press 'Add' to create a DAT with default scripts.

## Parameters - Extensions Page
The Extensions parameter page sets the component's python extensions. Please see [extensions](https://docs.derivative.ca/Extensions "Extensions") for more information.
- Re-Init Extensions `reinitextensions` - Recompile all extension objects. Normally extension objects are compiled only when they are referenced and their definitions have changed.
- Init Extensions On Start `initextonstart` - Perform a Re-Init automatically when TouchDEsigner Starts
- Extension `ext` - Sequence of info for creating extensions on this component
- Object `ext0object` - A number of class instances that can be attached to the component.
- Name `ext0name` - Optional name to search by, instead of the instance class name.
- Promote `ext0promote` - Controls whether or not the extensions are visible directly at the component level, or must be accessed through the `.ext` member. Example: `n.Somefunction` vs `n.ext.Somefunction`

## Parameters - Common Page
The Common parameter page sets the component's [node viewer](https://docs.derivative.ca/Node_Viewer "Node Viewer") and [clone](https://docs.derivative.ca/Clone "Clone") relationships.
- Parent Shortcut `parentshortcut` - Specifies a name you can use anywhere inside the component as the path to that component. See [Parent Shortcut](https://docs.derivative.ca/Parent_Shortcut "Parent Shortcut").
- Global OP Shortcut `opshortcut` - Specifies a name you can use anywhere at all as the path to that component. See [Global OP Shortcut](https://docs.derivative.ca/Global_OP_Shortcut "Global OP Shortcut").
- Internal OP `iop` - Sequence header for internal operators.
- Shortcut `iop0shortcut` - Specifies a name you can use anywhere inside the component as a path to "Internal OP" below. See [Internal Operators](https://docs.derivative.ca/Internal_Operators "Internal Operators").
- OP `iop0op` - The path to the Internal OP inside this component. See [Internal Operators](https://docs.derivative.ca/Internal_Operators "Internal Operators").
- Node View `nodeview` - ⊞ - Determines what is displayed in the node viewer, also known as the [Node Viewer](https://docs.derivative.ca/Node_Viewer "Node Viewer"). Some options will not be available depending on the Component type ([Object Component](https://docs.derivative.ca/Object_Component "Object Component"), [Panel Component](https://docs.derivative.ca/Panel_Component "Panel Component"), Misc.)
  * Default Viewer `default` - Displays the default viewer for the component type, a 3D Viewer for Object COMPS and a Control Panel Viewer for Panel COMPs.
  * Operator Viewer `opviewer` - Displays the node viewer from any operator specified in the Operator Viewer parameter below.

- Operator Viewer `opviewer` - Select which operator's node viewer to use when the Node View parameter above is set to Operator Viewer.
- Keep in Memory `keepmemory` -
- Enable Cloning `enablecloning` - Control if the OP should be actively cloneing. Turning this off causes this node to stop cloning it's 'Clone Master'.
- Enable Cloning Pulse `enablecloningpulse` - Instantaneously clone the contents.
- Clone Master `clone` - Path to a component used as the Master [Clone](https://docs.derivative.ca/Clone "Clone").
- Load on Demand `loadondemand` - Loads the component into memory only when required. Good to use for components that are not always used in the project.
- Enable External .tox `enableexternaltox` - When on (default), the external .tox file will be loaded when the .toe starts and the contents of the COMP will match that of the external .tox. This can be turned off to avoid loading from the referenced external .tox on startup if desired (the contents of the COMP are instead loaded from the .toe file). Useful if you wish to have a COMP reference an external .tox but not always load from it unless you specifically push the Re-Init Network parameter button.
- Enable External .tox Pulse `enableexternaltoxpulse` - This button will re-load from the external `.tox` file (if present).
- External .tox Path `externaltox` - Path to a `.tox` file on disk which will source the component's contents upon start of a `.toe`. This allows for components to contain networks that can be updated independently. If the `.tox` file can not be found, whatever the `.toe` file was saved with will be loaded.
- Reload Custom Parameters `reloadcustom` - When this checkbox is enabled, the values of the component's [Custom Parameters](https://docs.derivative.ca/Custom_Parameters "Custom Parameters") are reloaded when the [.tox](https://docs.derivative.ca/.tox ".tox") is reloaded. This only affects top-level parameters on the component, all parameters on nodes inside the component are always reloaded with the [.tox](https://docs.derivative.ca/.tox ".tox").
- Reload Built-In Parameters `reloadbuiltin` - When this checkbox is enabled, the values of the component's built-in parameters are reloaded when the [.tox](https://docs.derivative.ca/.tox ".tox") is reloaded. This only affects top-level parameters on the component, all parameters on nodes inside the component are always reloaded with the [.tox](https://docs.derivative.ca/.tox ".tox").
- Save Backup of External `savebackup` - When this checkbox is enabled, a backup copy of the component specified by the External `.tox` parameter is saved in the `.toe` file. This backup copy will be used if the External `.tox` can not be found. This may happen if the `.tox` was renamed, deleted, or the `.toe` file is running on another computer that is missing component media.
- Sub-Component to Load `subcompname` - When loading from an External `.tox` file, this option allows you to reach into the `.tox` and pull out a COMP and make that the top-level COMP, ignoring everything else in the file (except for the contents of that COMP). For example if a `.tox` file named `project1.tox` contains `project1/geo1`, putting `geo1` as the Sub-Component to Load, will result in `geo1` being loaded in place of the current COMP. If this parameter is blank, it just loads the `.tox` file normally using the top level COMP in the file.
- Relative File Path Behavior `relpath` - ⊞ - Set whether the child file paths within this COMP are relative to the .toe itself or the .tox, or inherit from parent.
  * Use Parent's Behavior `inherit` - Inherit setting from parent.
  * Relative to Project File (.toe) `project` - The path, when specified as a relative path, will be relative to the .toe file.
  * Relative to External COMP File (.tox) `externaltox` - The path, when specified as a relative path, will be relative to the .tox file. When no external COMP file is specified, or when Enable External .tox is not toggled on, this doesn't have any impact.

- Parameter Color Space `parmcolorspace` - ⊞ - Controls how all color parameters on this node are interpreted. The color values as treated as being in the selected color space, and are converted to the Working [Color Space](https://docs.derivative.ca/Color_Space "Color Space") before they are used as part of the node's operation. Note that this does not change the color space of the node itself, as that is always in the Working Color Space.
  * sRGB `srgb` - [sRGB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SRGB) color space, with sRGB transfer function. Considered an SDR color space with respect to Reference White.

  * Passthrough `passthrough` - When selected, the color values will be used as-is in the operation, without any modification or attempt to convert them into the Working Color Space.

- Parameter Reference White `parmreferencewhite` - ⊞ - When converting a parameter color value to the Working Color Space, this controls how it should be treated with respect to [Reference White](https://docs.derivative.ca/Color_Space#Reference_White "Color Space"). If the Working Color Space is the same Reference White, then no adjustment is done. If they are different, then the Reference White level (brightness) of this color will be adjusted to the range expected by the Working Color Space. For example if the project is set to have a SDR Reference White of 120 nits, and the HDR Reference White is 80 nits, then a color of (1, 1, 1), which is 120 nits in the SDR color space, will be converted to be (1.5, 1.5, 1.5), which is 120 nits still in the HDR Working Color Space.
  * Default For Color Space `default` - Will use either the SDR or the HDR Reference White, based on the color space selected.
  * Use Parent Panel `useparent` - Will use the Reference White that the parent panel has selected. If the top-level panel also has 'Use Parent' selected, then 'UI Reference White' will be used.
  * Standard (SDR) `sdr` - Will treat the Parameter Color Space as SDR for it's reference white value.
  * High (HDR) `hdr` - Will treat the Parameter Color Space as HDR for it's reference white value.
  * UI `ui` - Will treat the Parameter Color Space as UI for it's reference white value. This uses the 'UI Reference White Nits' value for it's brightness.
