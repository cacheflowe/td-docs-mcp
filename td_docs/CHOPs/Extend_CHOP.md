# Extend CHOP
## Summary

The Extend CHOP only sets the "extend conditions" of a CHOP, which determines what values you get when sampling the CHOP before or after its interval.
The Extend CHOP has separate menus to control both the pre-interval and the post-interval. For example, before the interval, you may want to hold a constant value, and after the interval you may want to cycle or repeat the curves in the interval.
To shorten or lengthen the interval (the start or end of the CHOP), use the [Trim CHOP](https://docs.derivative.ca/Trim_CHOP "Trim CHOP").
You can see the state of Extend Conditions in the pop-up info of any CHOP (use middle-mouse click on the CHOP).

## Parameters - Extend Page
- Left Behavior `left` - ⊞ - The extend condition before the CHOP interval. They are:
  * No Change `asis` - Leave the channel as is.
  * Hold `hold` - Hold the current value of the channel.
  * Slope `slope` - Continue the slope before the start of the channel.
  * Cycle `cycle` - Cycle the channel repeatedly.
  * Mirror `mirror` - Cycle the channel repeatedly, mirroring every other cycle.
  * Default Value `default` - Use the constant value specified in the Default Value parameter.

- Right Behavior `right` - ⊞ - Extend condition after the interval. Same options as Extend Left.
  * No Change `asis` - Leave the channel as is.
  * Hold `hold` - Hold the current value of the channel.
  * Slope `slope` - Continue the slope after the end of the channel.
  * Cycle `cycle` - Cycle the channel repeatedly.
  * Mirror `mirror` - Cycle the channel repeatedly, mirroring every other cycle.
  * Default Value `default` - Use the constant value specified in the Default Value parameter.

- Default Value `defval` - The value used for the Default Value extend condition.

## Parameters - Common Page
- Time Slice `timeslice` - Turning this on forces the channels to be "[Time Sliced](https://docs.derivative.ca/Time_Slicing "Time Slicing")". A Time Slice is the time between the last cook frame and the current cook frame.
- Scope `scope` - To determine which channels get affected, some CHOPs use a Scope string on the Common page. See [Pattern Matching](https://docs.derivative.ca/Pattern_Matching "Pattern Matching").
- Sample Rate Match `srselect` - ⊞ - Handle cases where multiple input CHOPs' sample rates are different. When Resampling occurs, the curves are interpolated according to the Interpolation Method Option, or "Linear" if the Interpolate Options are not available.
  * Resample At First Input's Rate `first` - Use rate of first input to resample others.
  * Resample At Maximum Rate `max` - Resample to the highest sample rate.
  * Resample At Minimum Rate `min` - Resample to the lowest sample rate.
  * Error If Rates Differ `err` - Doesn't accept conflicting sample rates.

- Export Method `exportmethod` - ⊞ - This will determine how to connect the CHOP channel to the parameter. Refer to the [Export](https://docs.derivative.ca/Export "Export") article for more information.
  * DAT Table by Index `datindex` - Uses the docked DAT table and references the channel via the index of the channel in the CHOP.
  * DAT Table by Name `datname` - Uses the docked DAT table and references the channel via the name of the channel in the CHOP.
  * Channel Name is Path:Parameter `autoname` - The channel is the full destination of where to export to, such has `geo1/transform1:tx`.

- Export Root `autoexportroot` - This path points to the root node where all of the paths that exporting by **Channel Name is Path:Parameter** are relative to.
- Export Table `exporttable` - The DAT used to hold the export information when using the DAT Table Export Methods (See above).
- Rename from `commonrenamefrom` - The channel pattern to rename. See [Pattern Matching](https://docs.derivative.ca/Pattern_Matching "Pattern Matching").
- Rename to `commonrenameto` - The replacement pattern for the names. The default parameters do not rename the channels. See [Pattern Replacement](https://docs.derivative.ca/Pattern_Replacement "Pattern Replacement").
**Example:**     Channel Names: `c[1-10:2] ambient`     Rename From: `c* ambient`     Rename To: `b[1-5] amb`
This example fetches channels `c1 c3 c5 c7 c9` and `ambient`.
They are then renamed to to `b1 b2 b3 b4 b5` and `amb`.
See the [Rename CHOP](https://docs.derivative.ca/Rename_CHOP "Rename CHOP") for a further description of rename patterns.
