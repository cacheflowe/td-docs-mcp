# EtherDream CHOP
## Summary

**DEPRECATED:** use the [Laser Device CHOP](https://docs.derivative.ca/Laser_Device_CHOP "Laser Device CHOP") instead.
EtherDream is a laser controller. The EtherDream CHOP takes as input up to five channels interpreted as X and Y (horizontal and vertical) position values in the first 2 channels, and red, green and blue color values in the next 3 channels. It outputs the data to an [EtherDream](http://ether-dream.com/) device via a network connection. The EtherDream device is connected to a laser using an ILDA cable. The user can then control the image that the laser should output using the EtherDream CHOP. Applications of the EtherDream CHOP include displaying computer-generated shape animations or other special effects of a light show.
The EtherDream CHOP needs the IP address of the EtherDream device, which you can get from the output of an [EtherDream DAT](https://docs.derivative.ca/EtherDream_DAT "EtherDream DAT").
Blanking (all-off) occurs when the incoming RGB CHOP channels are all zero, or the Red Scale, Green Scale, and Blue Scale parameters are all zero.
It is sometimes helpful to have additional information with respect to the general state of the hardware, whether any warnings are generated by the connected devices, how well the EtherDream is receiving points, the point output rate, and the point buffer capacity. Such details can be seen by connecting the EtherDream CHOP to an [Info CHOP](https://docs.derivative.ca/Info_CHOP "Info CHOP"), and may be useful for troubleshooting display images.
The `maxrate` column of the EtherDream DAT indicates the maximum number of samples per second that can be sent to the EtherDream device, though in practice, most lasers are reflected into position by a set of mechanical reflectors, with their own mechanical characteristics. As a result, attempting to quickly scan a square over a large area too quickly, for example, may result in a very curved corners as the physical components lag behind their target positions.
Large changes in RGB values from sample-to-sample will likely be visibly correct as lasers generally can switch on-off quickly.
The range of X and Y is typically -1 to +1, and the range of RGB is typically 0 to 1.
If `maxrate` is 100,000, and given that the CHOP takes time-sliced data, it is appropriate to send a time-sliced CHOP with a sample rate of up to 100,000 samples per second to the EtherDream CHOP.

## Parameters - Ether Dream Page
- Active `active` - If turned off, the EtherDream CHOP will stop sending data to the EtherDream and will immediately clear its point buffer. Consider it equivalent to powering off the EtherDream.
- Network Address `netaddress` - Set this parameter to the network address that both the EtherDream and the user's computer are connected to. It should have the following format: `xxx.xxx.xx.xxx`
To determine the required network address and to identify if the EtherDream is properly connected to the network, install and run the [EtherDream Diagnostic Tool](http://ether-dream.com/downloads.html).
- Network Port `port` - By default, the EtherDream uses TCP Port `7765`. Firewall settings may need to be adjusted to allow for the EtherDream CHOP to properly communicate with the EtherDream.
- Queue Time `queuetime` - Determines the queue size of the EtherDream point buffer and the corresponding time required to drain it. It is often useful to reduce this value when sending fewer points.
- Queue Units `queueunits` - Select the units to use for this parameter, Samples, Frames, or Seconds.
- X Scale `xscale` - Allows the input x values to be scaled by the specified factor.
- Y Scale `yscale` - Allows the input y values to be scaled by the specified factor.
- Red Scale `redscale` - Allows the input r values to be scaled by the specified factor.
- Green Scale `greenscale` - Allows the input g values to be scaled by the specified factor.
- Blue Scale `bluescale` - Allows the input b values to be scaled by the specified factor.

## Parameters - Common Page
- Time Slice `timeslice` - Turning this on forces the channels to be "[Time Sliced](https://docs.derivative.ca/Time_Slicing "Time Slicing")". A Time Slice is the time between the last cook frame and the current cook frame.
- Scope `scope` - To determine which channels get affected, some CHOPs use a Scope string on the Common page. See [Pattern Matching](https://docs.derivative.ca/Pattern_Matching "Pattern Matching").
- Sample Rate Match `srselect` - ⊞ - Handle cases where multiple input CHOPs' sample rates are different. When Resampling occurs, the curves are interpolated according to the Interpolation Method Option, or "Linear" if the Interpolate Options are not available.
  * Resample At First Input's Rate `first` - Use rate of first input to resample others.
  * Resample At Maximum Rate `max` - Resample to the highest sample rate.
  * Resample At Minimum Rate `min` - Resample to the lowest sample rate.
  * Error If Rates Differ `err` - Doesn't accept conflicting sample rates.

- Export Method `exportmethod` - ⊞ - This will determine how to connect the CHOP channel to the parameter. Refer to the [Export](https://docs.derivative.ca/Export "Export") article for more information.
  * DAT Table by Index `datindex` - Uses the docked DAT table and references the channel via the index of the channel in the CHOP.
  * DAT Table by Name `datname` - Uses the docked DAT table and references the channel via the name of the channel in the CHOP.
  * Channel Name is Path:Parameter `autoname` - The channel is the full destination of where to export to, such has `geo1/transform1:tx`.

- Export Root `autoexportroot` - This path points to the root node where all of the paths that exporting by **Channel Name is Path:Parameter** are relative to.
- Export Table `exporttable` - The DAT used to hold the export information when using the DAT Table Export Methods (See above).
- Rename from `commonrenamefrom` - The channel pattern to rename. See [Pattern Matching](https://docs.derivative.ca/Pattern_Matching "Pattern Matching").
- Rename to `commonrenameto` - The replacement pattern for the names. The default parameters do not rename the channels. See [Pattern Replacement](https://docs.derivative.ca/Pattern_Replacement "Pattern Replacement").
**Example:**     Channel Names: `c[1-10:2] ambient`     Rename From: `c* ambient`     Rename To: `b[1-5] amb`
This example fetches channels `c1 c3 c5 c7 c9` and `ambient`.
They are then renamed to to `b1 b2 b3 b4 b5` and `amb`.
See the [Rename CHOP](https://docs.derivative.ca/Rename_CHOP "Rename CHOP") for a further description of rename patterns.
