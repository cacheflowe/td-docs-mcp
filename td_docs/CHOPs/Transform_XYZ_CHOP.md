# Transform XYZ CHOP
## Summary

The Transform XYZ CHOP is used to transform positions and vector. The difference between transforming a position vs. a vector is that a vector won't have the translation portion of the transformation applied to it.

The Transform XYZ CHOP first groups the channels from the first input by looking for '`x`', '`y`' and '`z`' as the last character in the channel names. Then it treats each of the sets created as either a Position or a Vector depending on the parameter choice. The second input can be connected, and must describe a transform in the same format of channels that the [Transform CHOP](https://docs.derivative.ca/Transform_CHOP "Transform CHOP") supports. The second input is combined with the 'Transform' page parameters, and the resulting transform is applied to the input positions and vectors.

CHOPs with multiple-samples can be provided, which allows for larger amount of positional data to be transformed in a single CHOP.
See also the [Transform CHOP](https://docs.derivative.ca/Transform_CHOP "Transform CHOP").

## Parameters - Input Page
This page defines how the inputs are treated.
- Input 0 Type `input0type` - ⊞ - Choose if the input 0 values should be treated as a position or a vectors. Vectors will not have the translation portion of the transform applied to them, and can be normalized before and/or after the transformation is applied.
  * Position `position` - Treat the input 0 values a positions.
  * Vector `vector` - Treat the input 0 values a vectors.

- Normalize `innormalize` - If the input is vectors, they can be normalized before the transformation is applied.
- Custom Input Order `custinputorder` - This allows the input order for input 1, if provided, to be ignored and overridden by a custom order chosen by the following two parameters.
- Transform Order `inxord` - ⊞ - Changing the Transform order will change where things go much the same way as going a block and turning east gets you to a different place than turning east and then going a block. In matrix math terms, if we use the 'multiply vector on the right' (column vector) convention, a transform order of Scale, Rotate, Translate would be written as T * R * S * Position
  * Scale Rotate Translate `srt` -
  * Scale Translate Rotate `str` -
  * Rotate Scale Translate `rst` -
  * Rotate Translate Scale `rts` -
  * Translate Scale Rotate `tsr` -
  * Translate Rotate Scale `trs` -

- Rotate Order `inrord` - ⊞ - As with transform order (above), changing the order in which the rotations take place will alter the final position and orientation. A Rotation order of Rx Ry Rz would create the final rotation matrix as follows R = Rz * Ry * Rx
  * Rx Ry Rz `xyz` -
  * Rx Rz Ry `xzy` -
  * Ry Rx Rz `yxz` -
  * Ry Rz Rx `yzx` -
  * Rz Rx Ry `zxy` -
  * Rz Ry Rx `zyx` -

- Input 1 Pre Operation `input1preop` - ⊞ - Operation(s) to apply on the transforms on Input 1, before they are combined with other transforms.
  * None `none` - No operation is applied.
  * Invert `invert` - Invert the transform.
  * Transpose `transpose` - Transpose the transform. This only has an effect for matrix format transforms.
  * Invert Transpose `inverttranspose` - Invert and Transpose the transform. The transpose will only be done if the input is a matrix format transform.

## Parameters - Transform Page
This page defines the transform that is applied to the input positions or vectors.
- Transform Order `xord` - ⊞ - See description from earlier Transform Order parameter.
  * Scale Rotate Translate `srt` -
  * Scale Translate Rotate `str` -
  * Rotate Scale Translate `rst` -
  * Rotate Translate Scale `rts` -
  * Translate Scale Rotate `tsr` -
  * Translate Rotate Scale `trs` -

- Rotate Order `rord` - ⊞ - See description from earlier Rotate Order parameter.
  * Rx Ry Rz `xyz` -
  * Rx Rz Ry `xzy` -
  * Ry Rx Rz `yxz` -
  * Ry Rz Rx `yzx` -
  * Rz Rx Ry `zxy` -
  * Rz Ry Rx `zyx` -

- Translate `t` - ⊞ - XYZ translation values.
  * X `tx` -
  * Y `ty` -
  * Z `tz` -

- Rotate `r` - ⊞ - XYZ rotation, in degrees.
  * X `rx` -
  * Y `ry` -
  * Z `rz` -

- Scale `s` - ⊞ - XYZ scale to shrink or enlarge the transform.
  * X `sx` -
  * Y `sy` -
  * Z `sz` -

- Pivot `p` - ⊞ - XYZ pivot to apply the above operations around.
  * X `px` -
  * Y `py` -
  * Z `pz` -

- Pre Operation `preop` - Turn this on to invert the transform generated by this page before combining it with the other terms.
- Multiply Order `multiplyorder` - ⊞ - Controls how the input transform(s) are combined with the transform specified on this page. The below two descriptions use a multiply "vector on the right" convention (column vectors).
  * Input, then Transform Page `inputxformpage` - The transforms will be combined as `Transform Page * Input`.
  * Transform Page, then Input `xformpageinput` - The transforms will be combined as `Input * Transform Page`.

## Parameters - Output Page
- Un-matched Channels `unmatchedchans` - ⊞ - Controls how channels that don't match the naming convention for the various transform format are treated.
  * Warn `warn` - Give a warning if transform channels that don't match any of the naming convenstions are found.
  * Ignore `ignore` - Ignore (give no warning) if channels that don't match the naming convention are found.
  * Delete `delete` - Delete all channels that don't match any of the naming conventions.

- Normalize `normalize` - If the input data is being treated as vectors, they can be re-normalized after the transform by turning this on.

## Parameters - Common Page
- Time Slice `timeslice` - Turning this on forces the channels to be "[Time Sliced](https://docs.derivative.ca/Time_Slicing "Time Slicing")". A Time Slice is the time between the last cook frame and the current cook frame.
- Scope `scope` - To determine which channels get affected, some CHOPs use a Scope string on the Common page. See [Pattern Matching](https://docs.derivative.ca/Pattern_Matching "Pattern Matching").
- Sample Rate Match `srselect` - ⊞ - Handle cases where multiple input CHOPs' sample rates are different. When Resampling occurs, the curves are interpolated according to the Interpolation Method Option, or "Linear" if the Interpolate Options are not available.
  * Resample At First Input's Rate `first` - Use rate of first input to resample others.
  * Resample At Maximum Rate `max` - Resample to the highest sample rate.
  * Resample At Minimum Rate `min` - Resample to the lowest sample rate.
  * Error If Rates Differ `err` - Doesn't accept conflicting sample rates.

- Export Method `exportmethod` - ⊞ - This will determine how to connect the CHOP channel to the parameter. Refer to the [Export](https://docs.derivative.ca/Export "Export") article for more information.
  * DAT Table by Index `datindex` - Uses the docked DAT table and references the channel via the index of the channel in the CHOP.
  * DAT Table by Name `datname` - Uses the docked DAT table and references the channel via the name of the channel in the CHOP.
  * Channel Name is Path:Parameter `autoname` - The channel is the full destination of where to export to, such has `geo1/transform1:tx`.

- Export Root `autoexportroot` - This path points to the root node where all of the paths that exporting by **Channel Name is Path:Parameter** are relative to.
- Export Table `exporttable` - The DAT used to hold the export information when using the DAT Table Export Methods (See above).
- Rename from `commonrenamefrom` - The channel pattern to rename. See [Pattern Matching](https://docs.derivative.ca/Pattern_Matching "Pattern Matching").
- Rename to `commonrenameto` - The replacement pattern for the names. The default parameters do not rename the channels. See [Pattern Replacement](https://docs.derivative.ca/Pattern_Replacement "Pattern Replacement").
**Example:**     Channel Names: `c[1-10:2] ambient`     Rename From: `c* ambient`     Rename To: `b[1-5] amb`
This example fetches channels `c1 c3 c5 c7 c9` and `ambient`.
They are then renamed to to `b1 b2 b3 b4 b5` and `amb`.
See the [Rename CHOP](https://docs.derivative.ca/Rename_CHOP "Rename CHOP") for a further description of rename patterns.

## Operator Inputs
  * Input 0: Position/Vectors - One or more sets of channels with 'x', 'y' and 'z' as the last character in their names, to be transformed.
  * Input 1: Transform - An optional additional transform that can be applied. Valid formats are the same as the [Transform CHOP](https://docs.derivative.ca/Transform_CHOP "Transform CHOP").
