# LFO CHOP
## Summary

The LFO CHOP (low frequency oscillator) generates waves in real-time in two ways. It synthesizes curves using a choice of common waveforms like Sine or Pulse, or it repeats a prepared incoming curve.
It steps through the waveform at a rate that depends on the Frequency parameter and the Octave Control input. To watch its behavior, attach a Trail CHOP to its output and alter the Frequency parameter.
Up to three input CHOPs can be connected to the LFO CHOP:
**Octave Control** - Without this first (optional) input, the frequency is simply the Frequency parameter. If this input is connected, every unit doubles the frequency: When Octave Control is 1, the frequency is double, when it is 2 it is 4x, when it is -1 the frequency is half the Frequency parameter and when it is 0, there is no change in the frequency.
**Reset** - The seond (optional) input contains on-off (<=0 or >0) that restarts the channels of the oscillator from the beginning of the wave. The reset depends on the setting of the Reset Condition menu. By default, when the Reset input goes from off to on, it resets the wave and starts the waveform immediately. If Reset Condition is set to "While On", the reset value will be held until the Reset input goes off. Reset means "stop the oscillator and cue it at the start of the waveform".
**Source Wave** - The third (optional) input is a replacement of the waveform Type. It is a multi-sample CHOP curve and can contain any number of channels, limited to the channels defined on the Channel page. The waveform Type parameter is disabled.
The LFO CHOP can serve as a general motion time-warper and repeater. If you alter the Frequency, you can control the time warp.
Unlike the [Wave CHOP](https://docs.derivative.ca/Wave_CHOP "Wave CHOP"), this is a time-sliced CHOP, that is, it generates its waveform as it goes, and speeds/slows how it steps through the waveform Type while the Frequency changes. Unlike the [Audio Oscillator CHOP](https://docs.derivative.ca/Audio_Oscillator_CHOP "Audio Oscillator CHOP"), the LFO CHOP is designed for non-audio frequencies.

## Parameters - LFO Page
- Type `wavetype` - ⊞ - The shape of the waveform to repeat, unless overridden by the Source Wave:
  * Sine `sin` - [![TouchChannels71.gif](https://docs.derivative.ca/images/a/ad/TouchChannels71.gif)](https://docs.derivative.ca/File:TouchChannels71.gif)(-1 to 1) A Sine wave.
  * Gaussian `normal` - [![TouchChannels74.gif](https://docs.derivative.ca/images/2/2b/TouchChannels74.gif)](https://docs.derivative.ca/File:TouchChannels74.gif)(0 to 1) A Gaussian (also known as a bell or normal) curve.
  * Triangle `tri` - [![TouchChannels76.gif](https://docs.derivative.ca/images/c/c0/TouchChannels76.gif)](https://docs.derivative.ca/File:TouchChannels76.gif)(-1 to 1) A ramp-up to 1 and ramp-down to -1 that can be shaped with the Bias parameter.
  * Ramp `ramp` - [![TouchChannels78.gif](https://docs.derivative.ca/images/c/cd/TouchChannels78.gif)](https://docs.derivative.ca/File:TouchChannels78.gif)(0 to 1) A ramp from 0 to 1.
  * Square `square` - [![TouchChannels80.gif](https://docs.derivative.ca/images/3/33/TouchChannels80.gif)](https://docs.derivative.ca/File:TouchChannels80.gif)(-1 to 1) Step-up/step-down, with Bias control to make it rectangular.
  * Pulse `pulse` - [![TouchChannels82.gif](https://docs.derivative.ca/images/c/c4/TouchChannels82.gif)](https://docs.derivative.ca/File:TouchChannels82.gif)Produces a 1 for one sample, 0 otherwise.

- Play `play` - The LFO oscillates when 1, and stops when 0. Think of it like play and pause.
- Frequency `frequency` - The cycles per second of the oscillation. When the Octave Control input is connected, it alters the frequency exponentially.
- Offset `offset` - Values output from the CHOP can have an offset added to them.
- Amplitude `amp` - Values output from the CHOP can be scaled.
- Bias `bias` - Shape control for Triangle, Gaussian and Square waves. For triangle waves, it moves the peak. For square waves, it alters the width of the peak. Zero means no bias.
- Phase `phase` - A value of .5 is a phase shift of 180 degrees, or one half cycle.
- Reset Condition `resetcondition` - ⊞ - This menu determines how the Reset input triggers resetting the channel(s).
  * Off to On `offtoon` - Channels are reset when the Reset input goes off to on.
  * While On `on` - Channels are reset when the Reset input goes on. The channel will hold the reset value until the input turns off.
  * On to Off `ontooff` - Channels are reset when the Reset input goes on to off.
  * While Off `off` - Channels are reset when the Reset input goes off. The channel will hold the reset value until the input turns on.

- Reset `reset` - This toggle resets the channel(s) to 0 while On.
- Reset Pulse `resetpulse` - This button instantly resets the channel(s) to 0.

## Parameters - Channel Page
- Channel Name `channelname` - A list of the names of the channels. You can put patterns like `chan[1-10]` to generate 10 channels. See [Pattern Expansion](https://docs.derivative.ca/Pattern_Expansion "Pattern Expansion").
Each channel can be different by putting the channel index variable, `$C` in parameters like the frequency channel.
- Sample Rate `rate` - The sample rate of the CHOP. The default sample rate is 60 samples per second.

## Parameters - Common Page
- Time Slice `timeslice` - Turning this on forces the channels to be "[Time Sliced](https://docs.derivative.ca/Time_Slicing "Time Slicing")". A Time Slice is the time between the last cook frame and the current cook frame.
- Scope `scope` - To determine which channels get affected, some CHOPs use a Scope string on the Common page.
- Sample Rate Match `srselect` - ⊞ - Handle cases where multiple input CHOPs' sample rates are different. When Resampling occurs, the curves are interpolated according to the Interpolation Method Option, or "Linear" if the Interpolate Options are not available.
  * Resample At First Input's Rate `first` - Use rate of first input to resample others.
  * Resample At Maximum Rate `max` - Resample to the highest sample rate.
  * Resample At Minimum Rate `min` - Resample to the lowest sample rate.
  * Error If Rates Differ `err` - Doesn't accept conflicting sample rates.

- Export Method `exportmethod` - ⊞ - This will determine how to connect the CHOP channel to the parameter. Refer to the [Export](https://docs.derivative.ca/Export "Export") article for more information.
  * DAT Table by Index `datindex` - Uses the docked DAT table and references the channel via the index of the channel in the CHOP.
  * DAT Table by Name `datname` - Uses the docked DAT table and references the channel via the name of the channel in the CHOP.
  * Channel Name is Path:Parameter `autoname` - The channel is the full destination of where to export to, such has `geo1/transform1:tx`.

- Export Root `autoexportroot` - This path points to the root node where all of the paths that exporting by **Channel Name is Path:Parameter** are relative to.
- Export Table `exporttable` - The DAT used to hold the export information when using the DAT Table Export Methods (See above).
