# CPlusPlus CHOP
## Summary

The CPlusPlus CHOP allows you to make custom CHOP operators by writing your own plugin using C++.
See [Write a CPlusPlus Plugin](https://docs.derivative.ca/Write_a_CPlusPlus_Plugin "Write a CPlusPlus Plugin") and the other articles in the [ C++ Category](https://docs.derivative.ca/Category:C%2B%2B "Category:C++") for more detailed information on how to make plugins for use with this node and how to access example projects.

## Parameters - Load Page
- Plugin Path `plugin` - The path to the plugin you want to load.
- Re-Init Class `reinit` - When this parameter is On, it will delete the instance of the class created by the plugin, and create a new one.
- Re-Init Class `reinitpulse` - Instantly reinitialize the class.
- Unload Plugin `unloadplugin` - When this parameter goes above 1, it will delete the instance of the class created by the plugin and unload the plugin. If multiple CHOPs have loaded the same plugin, they will all need to unload it to release the file.

## Parameters - Common Page
- Time Slice `timeslice` - Turning this on forces the channels to be "[Time Sliced](https://docs.derivative.ca/Time_Slicing "Time Slicing")". A Time Slice is the time between the last cook frame and the current cook frame.
- Scope `scope` - To determine which channels get affected, some CHOPs use a Scope string on the Common page. See [Pattern Matching](https://docs.derivative.ca/Pattern_Matching "Pattern Matching").
- Sample Rate Match `srselect` - ⊞ - Handle cases where multiple input CHOPs' sample rates are different. When Resampling occurs, the curves are interpolated according to the Interpolation Method Option, or "Linear" if the Interpolate Options are not available.
  * Resample At First Input's Rate `first` - Use rate of first input to resample others.
  * Resample At Maximum Rate `max` - Resample to the highest sample rate.
  * Resample At Minimum Rate `min` - Resample to the lowest sample rate.
  * Error If Rates Differ `err` - Doesn't accept conflicting sample rates.

- Export Method `exportmethod` - ⊞ - This will determine how to connect the CHOP channel to the parameter. Refer to the [Export](https://docs.derivative.ca/Export "Export") article for more information.
  * DAT Table by Index `datindex` - Uses the docked DAT table and references the channel via the index of the channel in the CHOP.
  * DAT Table by Name `datname` - Uses the docked DAT table and references the channel via the name of the channel in the CHOP.
  * Channel Name is Path:Parameter `autoname` - The channel is the full destination of where to export to, such has `geo1/transform1:tx`.

- Export Root `autoexportroot` - This path points to the root node where all of the paths that exporting by **Channel Name is Path:Parameter** are relative to.
- Export Table `exporttable` - The DAT used to hold the export information when using the DAT Table Export Methods (See above).
- Rename from `commonrenamefrom` - The channel pattern to rename. See [Pattern Matching](https://docs.derivative.ca/Pattern_Matching "Pattern Matching").
- Rename to `commonrenameto` - The replacement pattern for the names. The default parameters do not rename the channels. See [Pattern Replacement](https://docs.derivative.ca/Pattern_Replacement "Pattern Replacement").
**Example:**     Channel Names: `c[1-10:2] ambient`     Rename From: `c* ambient`     Rename To: `b[1-5] amb`
This example fetches channels `c1 c3 c5 c7 c9` and `ambient`.
They are then renamed to to `b1 b2 b3 b4 b5` and `amb`.
See the [Rename CHOP](https://docs.derivative.ca/Rename_CHOP "Rename CHOP") for a further description of rename patterns.

## Operator Inputs
  * Input 0:  -

## Info CHOP Channels
Extra Information for the CPlusPlus CHOP can be accessed via an [Info CHOP](https://docs.derivative.ca/Info_CHOP "Info CHOP").
###
## Common CHOP Info Channels
  * start - Start of the CHOP interval in samples.

  * length - Number of samples in the CHOP.

  * sample_rate - The samplerate of the channels in frames per second.

  * num_channels - Number of channels in the CHOP.

  * time_slice - 1 if CHOP is Time Slice enabled, 0 otherwise.

  * export_sernum - A count of how often the export connections have been updated.

###
## Common Operator Info Channels
  * total_cooks - Number of times the operator has cooked since the process started.

  * cook_time - Duration of the last cook in milliseconds.

  * cook_frame - Frame number when this operator was last cooked relative to the component timeline.

  * cook_abs_frame - Frame number when this operator was last cooked relative to the absolute time.

  * cook_start_time - Time in milliseconds at which the operator started cooking in the frame it was cooked.

  * cook_end_time - Time in milliseconds at which the operator finished cooking in the frame it was cooked.

  * cooked_this_frame - 1 if operator was cooked this frame.

  * warnings - Number of warnings in this operator if any.

  * errors - Number of errors in this operator if any.
