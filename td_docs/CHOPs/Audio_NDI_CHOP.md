# Audio NDI CHOP
## Summary

Retrieves the audio from a [NDI In TOP](https://docs.derivative.ca/NDI_In_TOP "NDI In TOP")'s NDI stream. The audio signal can then be modified or output via CHOPs. See [NDI](https://docs.derivative.ca/NDI "NDI").
[audiondiCHOP_Class](https://docs.derivative.ca/AudiondiCHOP_Class "AudiondiCHOP Class")

## Parameters - "NDI Audio" Page
- Play `play` - When 'On' the audio will playback, when 'Off' the channels will not output an audio signal.
- NDI In TOP `ndiintop` - Specify which [NDI In TOP](https://docs.derivative.ca/NDI_In_TOP "NDI In TOP")'s NDI stream to get the audio from.
## Parameters - Common Page
- Time Slice `timeslice` - Turning this on forces the channels to be "[Time Sliced](https://docs.derivative.ca/Time_Slicing "Time Slicing")". A Time Slice is the time between the last cook frame and the current cook frame.
- Scope `scope` - To determine which channels get affected, some CHOPs use a Scope string on the Common page.
- Sample Rate Match `srselect` - ⊞ - Handle cases where multiple input CHOPs' sample rates are different. When Resampling occurs, the curves are interpolated according to the Interpolation Method Option, or "Linear" if the Interpolate Options are not available.
  * Resample At First Input's Rate `first` - Use rate of first input to resample others.
  * Resample At Maximum Rate `max` - Resample to the highest sample rate.
  * Resample At Minimum Rate `min` - Resample to the lowest sample rate.
  * Error If Rates Differ `err` - Doesn't accept conflicting sample rates.

- Export Method `exportmethod` - ⊞ - This will determine how to connect the CHOP channel to the parameter. Refer to the [Export](https://docs.derivative.ca/Export "Export") article for more information.
  * DAT Table by Index `datindex` - Uses the docked DAT table and references the channel via the index of the channel in the CHOP.
  * DAT Table by Name `datname` - Uses the docked DAT table and references the channel via the name of the channel in the CHOP.
  * Channel Name is Path:Parameter `autoname` - The channel is the full destination of where to export to, such has `geo1/transform1:tx`.

- Export Root `autoexportroot` - This path points to the root node where all of the paths that exporting by **Channel Name is Path:Parameter** are relative to.
- Export Table `exporttable` - The DAT used to hold the export information when using the DAT Table Export Methods (See above).

## Info CHOP Channels
