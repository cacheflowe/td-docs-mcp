# Point SOP
## Summary

The Point SOP allows you to get right into the geometry and manipulate the position, color, texture coordinates, and normals of the points in the Source, and other attributes. The Point SOP also lets you create custom point attributes. It is the complement to the [Primitive SOP](https://docs.derivative.ca/Primitive_SOP "Primitive SOP"). Using a second input allows for combining of two SOPs using their respective expressions (see: [PointSOP Class](https://docs.derivative.ca/PointSOP_Class "PointSOP Class")). If the second input has less points than the first input, the points in the second input will be cycled.
For example, you can create point coloring, or flip the normals of incoming geometry. Using expressions in Position X, Y and Z, you can move any given input point to a new place as defined by the expression with any standard attributes.
The Width (width) attribute affects the line width in the [Line MAT](https://docs.derivative.ca/Line_MAT "Line MAT"). The Scale attribute (pscale) affects particle size, and in the [Line MAT](https://docs.derivative.ca/Line_MAT "Line MAT") it affects the dot size at each point.
**Tip** : For greater flexibility, use the [Script SOP](https://docs.derivative.ca/Script_SOP "Script SOP").

## Parameters - Point Page
- Group `group` - If there are input groups, specifying a group name in this field will cause this `SOP` to act only upon the group specified. Accepts patterns, as described in [Pattern Matching](https://docs.derivative.ca/Pattern_Matching "Pattern Matching").
- Position `t` - ⊞ - Expressions to translate the XYZ coordinates of a given point can be entered here. The attributes to modify here are: `me.inputPoint.x`, `me.inputPoint.y` and `me.inputPoint.z`.
Simply entering `me.inputPoint.x` into the Position X field means that the X coordinate of each point that comes in is passed straight through with no modification.
Changing this entry to `me.inputPoint.x+5` means that the X coordinate of each point that comes in will be displaced by 5 units. This expression can be expanded to produce many useful effects. Transformations can also be effected in the Y and Z fields.
  * Position `tx` -
  * Position `ty` -
  * Position `tz` -

- Weight `doweight` - ⊞ - Select between keeping the weight or adding a new weight.
  * Keep Weight `off` -
  * New Weight `on` -

- Weight `weight` - If you select 'New Weight' from the menu above, enter expressions here to control the values of the point weights here. The attribute to modify is: `me.inputPoint.w`. Values for the weight of the point can range from 0.0001 to infinity.
- Color `doclr` - ⊞ - Select between keeping the color, adding new color, or using no color.
  * Keep Color `off` -
  * Add Color `on` -
  * No Color `remove` -

- Color `diff` - ⊞ - If you select 'Add Color' from the menu above, Cd color attributes will be added/modified in the SOP. Enter expressions below to control the values of the point colors. The attributes to modify are: `me.inputColor[0]` for red, `me.inputColor[1]` for green, `me.inputColor[2]` for blue, and `me.inputColor[3]` for alpha.
If you select 'No Color' from the menu above, the Cd color attribute will be removed from the SOP.
  * Color `diffr` -
  * Color `diffg` -
  * Color `diffb` -

- Alpha `alpha` - Control the alpha attribute in the same manner as the rgb colors above. Alpha is Cd[3] and comes from input via `me.inputColor[3]`
- Normal `donml` - ⊞ - Select between keeping the normals, adding new normals, or using no normals.
  * Keep Normal `off` -
  * Add Normal `on` -
  * No Normal `remove` -

- Normals `n` - ⊞ - If you select 'Add Normal' from the menu above, N normal attributes will be added/modified in the SOP. Enter expressions to change a given point normal here. Point normals are directional vectors used by other SOPs, such as Turbulence, Facet and Copy. See [Attributes](https://docs.derivative.ca/index.php?title=Attributes&action=edit&redlink=1 "Attributes \(page does not exist\)") article for detailed information. The attributes to modify are: `me.inputNormal[0]`, `me.inputNormal[1]` and `me.inputNormal[2]`.
If you select 'No Normal' from the menu above, the N normal attribute will be removed from the SOP.

###
Flipping Normals
You can flip the point normals of incoming geometry by entering:
```
(-me.inputNormal[0] -me.inputNormal[1] -me.inputNormal[2])

```

in the fields with this parameter set to Add Normals. This works, because it takes the existing normals
```
(me.inputNormal[0] me.inputNormal[1] me.inputNormal[2])

```

and inverts them (the preceding - ).

The value of this attribute is multiplied by the size specified in the [Particle SOP](https://docs.derivative.ca/Particle_SOP "Particle SOP")'s render attributes to scale each particle. This attribute is used by the [Point Sprite MAT](https://docs.derivative.ca/Point_Sprite_MAT "Point Sprite MAT") when rendering point sprites.

  * No Scale `remove` -

- Scale `pscale` - If you select 'Add Scale' from the menu above, pscale attribute will be added/modified in the SOP. Enter expressions here to control the values of the point particle scales here. The attribute to modify is: `me.inputPoint.pscale[0]`.

- Edge F `doedgef` - ⊞ - Retains, adds, or removes edgef attributes for points, which only works on primitive face types. The force is directed in the direction of the edge leading from that point. If multiple vertices reference the same point, then the direction is the edge direction of the last primitive referencing the point.
If the face open, then the end point has an edge direction equal to that of the preceding point in that primitive.
**Note:** When edge forces are added using the Point SOP, the force directions are computed in the Point SOP itself. Thus, any following transformations do not effect these. If you wish for the edge directions to be transformed as well, all transformations must be done before the Point SOP. Only the edge forces function like this.
  * Keep Edge F `off` -
  * Add Edge F `on` -
  * No Edge F `remove` -

- Edge F `edgef` - If you select 'Add Edge F' from the menu above, edgef attribute will be added/modified in the SOP.
