# Texture Sampling Parameters
The Texture Sampling parameters can be accessed anywhere a [TOP](https://docs.derivative.ca/TOP "TOP") is being sampled for use in a material or shader. To open these parameters, click the "**+** " button to the right of the parameter. The _parameter_ portion of the internal names depends on what map parameter these parameters are related to. For example for the colormap parameter, extendu would be colormapextendu.
Extend U `/_parameter_extendu`- Sets the extend mode for the U coordiate/direction. Refer to[Texture Extend Modes](https://docs.derivative.ca/Texture_Extend_Modes "Texture Extend Modes") for more information.
Extend V `/_parameter_extendv`- Sets the extend mode for the V coordiate/direction. Refer to[Texture Extend Modes](https://docs.derivative.ca/Texture_Extend_Modes "Texture Extend Modes") for more information.
Extend W `/_parameter_extendw`- Sets the extend mode for the W coordiate/direction. Only used for[3D Texture](https://docs.derivative.ca/3D_Texture "3D Texture"). Refer to [Texture Extend Modes](https://docs.derivative.ca/Texture_Extend_Modes "Texture Extend Modes") for more information.
Filter `/_parameter_filter`- Controls how this TOP is filtered when it's gets used. See [Texture Filtering](https://docs.derivative.ca/Texture_Filtering "Texture Filtering") for more information.
Anisotropic Filter `/_parameter_anisotropy`- Controls the level of anisotropic filtering used on the TOP when it's sampled. This results in more samples when sampling a TOP, increasing the texturing quality. Refer to [Anisotropic Filtering](https://docs.derivative.ca/Anisotropic_Filtering "Anisotropic Filtering") for more information.
Texture Coord `/_parameter_coord`- Determines which set of texture coordinates to use (which texture layer).
Coord Interpolation `/_parameter_coordinterp`- Adjusts the interpolation of the texture coordinated between**Perspective Correct** and **Linear**(no perspective).
An [Operator Family](https://docs.derivative.ca/Operator_Family "Operator Family") that creates, composites and modifies images, and reads/writes images and movies to/from files and the network. TOPs run on the graphics card's GPU.
