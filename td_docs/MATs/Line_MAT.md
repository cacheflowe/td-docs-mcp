# Line MAT
## Summary

The Line MAT renders 3D line segments, dots and vectors. The line width and color can be varied based on distance to the camera, using two models: a 1/z dropoff (z = distance from camera), or a near-far distance rolloff model, where you set the width and color at the near and far distances, and you vary three rolloff controls.
For lines it renders different types of end caps and hinge/joints (round, box, arrow). The light model is flat-shaded (no affect from scene lighting). It draws edges (like polygon edges), points and vectors from points. There are different parameters to control the desired shape, as explained in the Parameter sections. It renders several primitive types: polygons, meshes, NURBS, quads, etc. It also manages closed polygons / open polygons.
You can render a dot at each point. You can render a vector at each point which uses any attribute, like Normal (N). The points or vectors can have their own colors and alpha.
Line Width is a resolution-independent quantity. A line width of 1 will draw a line that is 1/1000 the width of the image. This is true when used with orthographic cameras and perspective cameras.
To make the width of a line and its points vary per-point of a SOP, the width can be set by adding a point attribute `width` on the SOP being rendered. A value of 2 scales the width at that point by 2 times its normal width. New point attributes can be created with the [Point SOP](https://docs.derivative.ca/Point_SOP "Point SOP") Custom page. To affect per-point width and not affect the line width, use the point attribute `pscale`.
When you are animating Ortho Width or Field of View, you may want line widths to adjust more realistically. When the parameter "Width Affected by FOV/Ortho Width" is on, the behavior is different: For Ortho cameras, the drawn line width increases when Ortho Width drops below 1, (as if you are zooming into it), and decreases when Ortho Width increases above 1. For Perspective cameras, the drawn line width increases when Field of View drops below 90 degrees, and decreases when Field of View increases above 90 degrees. Note that when the parameter "Width Affected by FOV/Ortho Width" is on, lines are still resolution-independent.

## Parameters - Setup Page
This is a general setup page for globally control the shared features of Lines, Points, and Vectors. Every change in this page will affect all the three mentioned types.
- Depth Interpolation Model `depthinterpolationmodel` - ⊞ - Depth Interpolation Model depthmodel – a menu to select how the width of line items changes by their distance from the camera.
  * S Curve `scurve` - a bounded range for the width between the near and far planes (Distance Near and Far) that uses S Curve for a more dramatic and yet smooth (referring to the continuity of the curve) changes. The curve shape can be controlled by Bias, Steepness, and Linearize parameters.
  * Inverse Distance `inversedistance` - uses the inverse distance weighting which provides a more visually accurate changes on the final width.

- Inverse Distance Exponent `inversedistanceexponent` - When the Depth Interpolation Model is Inverse Distance, this determines how fast the widths/sizes decrease with distance. If it is set to 1 (default), the width goes down at the rate of 1/r. If it set to 2, it goes down by 1/(r*r), meaning that for lines/dots at a distance r that have a width of w, that line/dot at a distance twice as far away (2r) are 1/4 the width/size as they are at distance r.
- Distance Near `distancenear` - Specifies a near plane with a certain distance from the camera.
- Distance Far `distancefar` - Specifies a far plane with a certain distance from the camera.
- Width Near `widthnear` - Specifies a fixed width value when the distance from camera is less than or equal to Distance Near. See the Summary of this operator for an explantion of the treatment of line width.
- Width Far `widthfar` - Specifies a fixed width value when the distance from the camera is equal or bigger than the Distance Far. Note when the Near-Far Range option is selected as the Depth Model, any point in between Distance Near and Distance Far will be calculated based on sine curve.
- Width Affected by FOV/OrthoWidth `widthaffectedbyfov` - With this off (default), looking at a rendered image of a certain resolution, a line of with w will always be the same # of pixels wide as you change the field-of-view or ortho width. With this parameter on, a line of width w will be half the number of pixels wide if you double the field-of-view or double the ortho width. Relevant if you are animating camera zoom, for instance.
- Width Bias `widthbias` - Moves the S Curve’s bias backward or forward for width interpolation (only S Curve depth model).
- Width Steepness `widthsteepness` - Controls the steepness of the S Curve for width interpolation (only S Curve depth model). The higher the value of the steepness, you will notice more dramatic changes (higher slope) in the curve width. Also, with lower values of steepness, the curve transforms into a more linear form.
- Width Linearize `widthlinearize` - Control the amount of curvature in the curve for width interpolation (only S Curve depth model).
- Color Bias `colorbias` - Moves the S Curve’s bias backward or forward for color interpolation.
- Color Steepness `colorsteepness` - Controls the steepness of the S Curve for color interpolation.
- Color Linearize `colorlinearize` - Control the amount of curvature in the curve for color interpolation.
- Lift Direction `liftdirection` - ⊞ - If a line is being drawn on a polygon or its edge (the polygon being in another Geometry COMP + shader), and you need to lift it off the surface to be fully visible, this specifies whether to displace the line points toward the camera or along the line's normal (which can be the direction of the polygon's normal).
  * Along Camera Z Axis `alongcamerazaxis` - displace the points along Camera Z axis.
  * Along Normal `alongnormal` - displace the points along point's Normal vector.
  * Toward Camera `towardcamera` -

- Lift Scale `liftscale` - For lines that are drawn on top of filled polygons or along their edges, they may be cut off because they are rendered in the same place. To make it look good, you want to lift the line toward the camera or along its normal away from the surface. This parameter scales how far you lift the line off the surface to make it look good without separating them too far.
- Num Points in Circle `numptsincircle` - When drawing Points in Circle (Polygon) mode, or drawing end-caps, or elbows between edges, this determines how many points you would draw in a full-circle arc to simulate a circular shape. The lower the number, the faster it renders.

###
Depth Test
Depth-Testing is comparing the depth value of the pixel being drawn with the pixel currently in the [Frame-Buffer](https://docs.derivative.ca/index.php?title=Frame-Buffer&action=edit&redlink=1 "Frame-Buffer \(page does not exist\)"). A pixel that is determined to be in-front of the pixel currently in the Frame-Buffer will be drawn over it. Pixels that are determined to be behind the pixel currently in the Frame-Buffer will not be drawn. Depth-Testing allows geometry in a 3D scene to occlude geometry behind it, and be occluded by geometry in-front of it regardless of the order the geometry was drawn.
For a more detailed description of Depth-Testing, refer to the [Depth-Test](https://docs.derivative.ca/Depth-Test "Depth-Test") article.

- Write Depth Values `depthwriting` - If Write Depth Values is on, pixels that pass the depth-test will write their depth value to the Depth-Buffer. If this isn't on then no changes will be made to the Depth-Buffer, regardless of if the pixels drawn pass or fail the depth-test.
- Discard Pixels Based on Alpha `alphatest` - This enables or disables the pixel alpha test.
- Keep Pixels with Alpha `alphafunc` - ⊞ - This menu works in conjunction with the Alpha Threshold parameter below in determining which pixels to keep based on their alpha value.
  * Less Than `less` -

  * Greater Than `greater` -
  * Greater Than or Equal `greaterorequal` -

- Alpha Threshold `alphathreshold` - This value is what the pixel's alpha is compared to to determine if the pixel should be drawn. Pixels with alpha greater than the Alpha Threshold will be drawn. Pixels with alpha less than or equal to the Alpha Threshold will not be drawn.
- Wire Frame `wireframe` - ⊞ - Enables and disables wire-frame rendering with the option of OpenGL Tesselated or Topology based wireframes.
  * Off `off` -
  * OpenGL Tesselated Wire Frame `tesselated` -
  * Topology Wire Frame `topology` -

###

###
Wire Frame
The wire-frame feature will render the geometry as wire-frame, using the actual primitive type used in the render. What this means is surfaces like Metaballs, NURBs and Beziers will become a wire-frame of the triangles/triangle-strips used to render them (since these types of primitives can't be natively rendered in OpenGL).

###
Cull Face
The cull face parameter will cull faces from the render output. This can be used as an optimization or sometimes to remove artifacts. See [Back-Face Culling](https://docs.derivative.ca/Back-Face_Culling "Back-Face Culling") for more infomation.

###
Polygon Depth Offset
This feature pushes the polygons back into space a tiny fraction. This is useful when you are rendering two polygons directly on-top of each other and are experiencing [Z-Fighting](https://docs.derivative.ca/Z-Fighting "Z-Fighting"). Refer to [Polygon Depth Offset](https://docs.derivative.ca/Polygon_Depth_Offset "Polygon Depth Offset") for more information. This is also an important feature when doing [shadows](https://docs.derivative.ca/Shadows "Shadows").

- Parameter Color Space `parmcolorspace` - ⊞ - Controls how all color parameters on this node are interpreted. The color values as treated as being in the selected color space, and are converted to the Working [Color Space](https://docs.derivative.ca/Color_Space "Color Space") before they are used as part of the node's operation. Note that this does not change the color space of the node itself, as that is always in the Working Color Space.
  * sRGB `srgb` - [sRGB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SRGB) color space, with sRGB transfer function. Considered an SDR color space with respect to Reference White.
  * sRGB - Linear `srgblinear` - [sRGB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SRGB) color space, with linear transfer function. Considered an SDR color space with respect to Reference White.

  * DCI-P3 (D60) `dcip3d60` - [DCI-P3 "D60 sim"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DCI-P3) color space, with D60 white point, and 2.6 gamma transfer function. Considered an HDR color space with respect to Reference White.
  * Display-P3 (D65) `displayp3d65` - [Display-P3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DCI-P3) color space, with D65 white point, and sRGB gamma transfer function. Considered an HDR color space with respect to Reference White.

- Parameter Reference White `parmreferencewhite` - ⊞ - When converting a parameter color value to the Working Color Space, this controls how it should be treated with respect to [Reference White](https://docs.derivative.ca/Color_Space#Reference_White "Color Space"). If the Working Color Space is the same Reference White, then no adjustment is done. If they are different, then the Reference White level (brightness) of this color will be adjusted to the range expected by the Working Color Space. For example if the project is set to have a SDR Reference White of 120 nits, and the HDR Reference White is 80 nits, then a color of (1, 1, 1), which is 120 nits in the SDR color space, will be converted to be (1.5, 1.5, 1.5), which is 120 nits still in the HDR Working Color Space.
  * Default For Color Space `default` - Will use either the SDR or the HDR Reference White, based on the color space selected.
  * Use Parent Panel `useparent` - Will use the Reference White that the parent panel has selected. If the top-level panel also has 'Use Parent' selected, then 'UI Reference White' will be used.
