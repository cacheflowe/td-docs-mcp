# Point Sprite MAT
## Summary

The Point Sprite MAT allows you to control some attributes of Point Sprites (creatable using the [Particle SOP](https://docs.derivative.ca/Particle_SOP "Particle SOP"), [DAT to SOP](https://docs.derivative.ca/DAT_to_SOP "DAT to SOP"), or [Convert SOP](https://docs.derivative.ca/Convert_SOP "Convert SOP")). You can apply color, a color map, change the size of the created point sprite from a square to a rectangle, and scale the size of the point sprite.
A point sprite's final size controls the number of pixels wide/high it is, regardless of how far it is from the camera (unless you are using attenuation).

## Parameters - Point Sprite Page
- Color `color` - ⊞ - The color of the light reflected from the material.
  * Red `colorr` -
  * Green `colorg` -
  * Blue `colorb` -

- Alpha `alpha` - The opacity of the material. This parameter is multiplied by point alpha of the object.
- Post-Mult Color by Alpha `postmultalpha` - Enable/disable multiplying color by alpha.
- Color Map `colormap` - ⊞ - The color map to apply to the sprites. The Color Map will be multiplied by the color of the sprites. The Color Map parameter can also take 3D / 2D Texture Arrays (from the [Texture 3D TOP](https://docs.derivative.ca/Texture_3D_TOP "Texture 3D TOP") for example), and the w texture coordinate will select the correct map from the array.
The final size of the point sprite is controlled by the pscale point attribute (if present) getting multiplied of the result of the next 6 parameters. There are two types of scale this MAT can apply, and they are blended using the Attenuate Point Scale parameter to create one final point scale (which is multiplied by pscale).
- Extend U `colormapextendu` - ⊞ -
  * Hold `hold` -
  * Zero `zero` -
  * Repeat `repeat` -
  * Mirror `mirror` -

- Extend V `colormapextendv` - ⊞ -
  * Hold `hold` -
  * Zero `zero` -
  * Repeat `repeat` -
  * Mirror `mirror` -

- Extend W `colormapextendw` - ⊞ -
  * Hold `hold` -
  * Zero `zero` -
  * Repeat `repeat` -
  * Mirror `mirror` -

- Filter `colormapfilter` - ⊞ -
  * Nearest `nearest` -
  * Linear `linear` -
  * Mipmap Linear `mipmaplinear` -

- Anisotropic Filter `colormapanisotropy` - ⊞ -
  * Off `off` -
  * 2x `2x` -
  * 4x `4x` -
  * 8x `8x` -
  * 16x `16x` -

- Offset Left `offsetleft` - Crop the left side of the sprites.
- Offset Right `offsetright` - Crop the right side of the sprites.
- Offset Bottom `offsetbottom` - Crop the bottom side of the sprites.
- Offset Top `offsettop` - Crop the top side of the sprites.
- Constant Point Size `pointsize` - Sets the size of the sprites. The units of size is determined based on the option set under the 'Sizing Model' menu.
- Sizing Model `sizingmodel` - A menu that specifies how the size of the sprite is decided. If set to 'Constant/Attenuate', then the value set under the Constant Point Size Parameter specifies the number of pixels wide the sprite will be. It is a constant value that will be applied to all points evenly. And/or the Attenuation Parameters can be used to do distance based attenuation. When Attenuate Point Scale is 0, the point sprite size will be pscale * this value.
If set to 'Perspective Correct' then the value set under Constant Point Size specifies the size of the sprite in the standard world space units like all geo objects. If you set the value of 3 for Constant Point Size, then each sprite will be 3 worldspace units wide.
- Attenuate Point Scale `attenpscale` - This value blends between the Constant Point Scale and the Attenuated Point Scale. 0 means 100% constant point scale and 1 means 100% attenuated point scale.
Points that are closer than or at the Near distance from the camera will use the Near Point Scale, points between the Near Distance and Far Distance will use a blended scale between the Near Point Scale and the Far Point Scale. Points farther than the Far Point Distance will use the Far Point Scale.
- Attenuate Near Distance `attennear` - Points that are closer than or at this distance from the camera will use the Near Point Scale Parameter.
- Attenuate Far Distance `attenfar` - Points that are farther than or at this distance from the camera will use the Far Point Scale Parameter.
- Near Point Scale `attensizenear` - This point scale is applied at the near distance.
- Far Point Scale `attensizefar` - This point scale is applied at the far distance.
- Size Affected by FOV/OrthoWidth `sizeaffectedbyfov` - With this off (default), looking at a rendered image of a certain resolution, the size of the sprite will remain the same # of pixels wide as you change the field-of-view or ortho width. With this parameter on, the size of the sprite will be half the number of pixels wide if you double the field-of-view or double the ortho width. Relevant if you are animating camera zoom, for instance. This toggle only works when the Sizing Model is set to 'Perspective Correct'.

## Parameters - Deform Page
Refer to the [ Deform Article](https://docs.derivative.ca/Deforming_Geometry_\(Skinning\) "Deforming Geometry \(Skinning\)") for more information on doing deforms in TouchDesigner.
- Deform `dodeform` - Enables deforms on this material.

- pCaptPath Attrib `pcaptpath` - Specifies the name of the pCaptPath attribute to use. When your geometry has been put through a [Bone Group SOP](https://docs.derivative.ca/Bone_Group_SOP "Bone Group SOP"), the attributes will be split into names like pCaptPath0, pCaptPath1. You can only render 1 bone group at a time, so this should match the group you are rendering with this material.
- pCaptData Attrib `pcaptdata` - Much like pCaptPath Attrib.
- Skeleton Root Path `skelrootpath` - Specifies the path to the COMP where the root of the skeleton is located.
- MAT `mat` - When obtaining deform data from a MAT or a Deform In MAT, this is where that MAT is specified.

###
Depth Test
Depth-Testing is comparing the depth value of the pixel being drawn with the pixel currently in the [Frame-Buffer](https://docs.derivative.ca/index.php?title=Frame-Buffer&action=edit&redlink=1 "Frame-Buffer \(page does not exist\)"). A pixel that is determined to be in-front of the pixel currently in the Frame-Buffer will be drawn over it. Pixels that are determined to be behind the pixel currently in the Frame-Buffer will not be drawn. Depth-Testing allows geometry in a 3D scene to occlude geometry behind it, and be occluded by geometry in-front of it regardless of the order the geometry was drawn.
For a more detailed description of Depth-Testing, refer to the [Depth-Test](https://docs.derivative.ca/Depth-Test "Depth-Test") article.

- Write Depth Values `depthwriting` - If Write Depth Values is on, pixels that pass the depth-test will write their depth value to the Depth-Buffer. If this isn't on then no changes will be made to the Depth-Buffer, regardless of if the pixels drawn pass or fail the depth-test.
- Discard Pixels Based on Alpha `alphatest` - This enables or disables the pixel alpha test.
- Keep Pixels with Alpha `alphafunc` - ⊞ - This menu works in conjunction with the Alpha Threshold parameter below in determining which pixels to keep based on their alpha value.
  * Less Than `less` -
  * Less Than or Equal `lessorequal` -
  * Greater Than `greater` -
  * Greater Than or Equal `greaterorequal` -

- Alpha Threshold `alphathreshold` - This value is what the pixel's alpha is compared to to determine if the pixel should be drawn. Pixels with alpha greater than the Alpha Threshold will be drawn. Pixels with alpha less than or equal to the Alpha Threshold will not be drawn.
- Wire Frame `wireframe` - ⊞ - Enables and disables wire-frame rendering with the option of OpenGL Tesselated or Topology based wireframes.
  * Off `off` -
  * OpenGL Tesselated Wire Frame `tesselated` -
  * Topology Wire Frame `topology` -

###
Alpha Test
Alpha-testing allows you to choose to draw or not draw a pixel based on its alpha value.

- Line Width `wirewidth` - This value is the width that the wires will be. This value is in pixels.
- Cull Face `cullface` - ⊞ - Selects which faces to render.
  * Use Render Setting `userender` - Use the render settings found in the Render or Render Pass TOP.
  * Neither `neither` - Do not cull any faces, render everything.
  * Back Faces `backfaces` - Cull back faces, render front faces.
  * Front Faces `frontfaces` - Cull front faces, render back faces.
  * Both Faces `bothfaces` - Cull both faces, render nothing.

- Polygon Depth Offset `polygonoffset` - Turns on the polygon offset feature.
- Offset Factor `polygonoffsetfactor` -
- Offset Units `polygonoffsetunits` -
###
Wire Frame
The wire-frame feature will render the geometry as wire-frame, using the actual primitive type used in the render. What this means is surfaces like Metaballs, NURBs and Beziers will become a wire-frame of the triangles/triangle-strips used to render them (since these types of primitives can't be natively rendered in OpenGL).

###
Cull Face
The cull face parameter will cull faces from the render output. This can be used as an optimization or sometimes to remove artifacts. See [Back-Face Culling](https://docs.derivative.ca/Back-Face_Culling "Back-Face Culling") for more infomation.

###
Polygon Depth Offset
This feature pushes the polygons back into space a tiny fraction. This is useful when you are rendering two polygons directly on-top of each other and are experiencing [Z-Fighting](https://docs.derivative.ca/Z-Fighting "Z-Fighting"). Refer to [Polygon Depth Offset](https://docs.derivative.ca/Polygon_Depth_Offset "Polygon Depth Offset") for more information. This is also an important feature when doing [shadows](https://docs.derivative.ca/Shadows "Shadows").

The color values as treated as being in the selected color space, and are converted to the Working [Color Space](https://docs.derivative.ca/Color_Space "Color Space") before they are used as part of the node's operation. Note that this does not change the color space of the node itself, as that is always in the Working Color Space.

If they are different, then the Reference White level (brightness) of this color will be adjusted to the range expected by the Working Color Space. For example if the project is set to have a SDR Reference White of 120 nits, and the HDR Reference White is 80 nits, then a color of (1, 1, 1), which is 120 nits in the SDR color space, will be converted to be (1.5, 1.5, 1.5), which is 120 nits still in the HDR Working Color Space.
  * Default For Color Space `default` - Will use either the SDR or the HDR Reference White, based on the color space selected.
