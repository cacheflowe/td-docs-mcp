# GLSL MAT
## Summary

The GLSL MAT allows you to write or import custom materials into TouchDesigner. When there are compile errors in a GLSL [shader](https://docs.derivative.ca/Shader "Shader"), a blue/red checkerboard _error_ shader will be displayed.
For more information on writing a shader, see [Write a GLSL Material](https://docs.derivative.ca/Write_a_GLSL_Material "Write a GLSL Material"), and the [GLSL Category](https://docs.derivative.ca/Category:GLSL "Category:GLSL").
[glslMAT_Class](https://docs.derivative.ca/GlslMAT_Class "GlslMAT Class")

## Parameters - Load Page
- GLSL Version `glslversion` - ⊞ - Pick what version of GLSL to compile the shader with.
  * 1.20 `glsl120` -
  * 3.30 `glsl330` -
  * 4.00 `glsl400` -
  * 4.10 `glsl410` -
  * 4.20 `glsl420` -
  * 4.30 `glsl430` -
  * 4.40 `glsl440` -
  * 4.50 `glsl450` -
  * 4.60 `glsl460` -

- Preprocess Directives `predat` - Use this DAT to place preprocessor directives at the start of your shader, such as #extension. This is required since these need to be the first lines in the shader, and TouchDesigner will be adding code to the start of your shader to declare uniforms/functions which would appear before #extension directives located in the main shader.
- Vertex Shader `vdat` - Path to the DAT that holds the vertex shader code.
- Pixel Shader `pdat` - Path to the DAT that holds the pixel shader code.
- Load Uniform Names `loaduniformnames` - This will read all the declared (and used) uniforms in the compiled GLSL shader, and fill in the various name fields for the uniform parameters.
- Clear Uniform Names `clearuniformnames` - This will clear all of the name fields for the uniform parameters.
- Geometry Shader `gdat` - Path to the DAT that holds the geometry shader code.
- Inherit Uniforms/Samplers from `inherit` - This Material will inherit all of the Textures and Uniforms from the GLSL Material referenced in this parameter.
- Lighting Space `lightingspace` - ⊞ - Allows lighting space switch from the current default World Space to legacy Camera Space which was used for TouchDesigner 088.
  * World Space `worldspace` -
  * Camera Space (Legacy 088 shaders) `cameraspace` -

- TDSimplexNoise() `simplexnoise` - ⊞ - Pick between Performance vs Quality Simplex noise. Performance mode picks the existing TDSimplexNoise(). Quality noise reduces certain artifacts and axis alignment issues with the existing simplex noise at the cost of speed.
  * Performance `performance` -
  * Quality `quality` -

- Input Primitive Type `inprim` - ⊞ - The type of geometry that will be inputed into the Geometry Shader.
  * Points `points` -
  * Lines `lines` -

  * Triangle Strip `tristrip` -

- Num Output Vertices `numout` - The maximum number of vertices the Geometry Shader will output.
- Two Sided Coloring `twocolor` - Enables support for two-sided coloring. When this is enabled the Vertex and/or Geometry shader can write to gl_FrontColor, gl_BackColor, gl_FrontSecondaryColor and gl_BackSecondaryColor and the correct color will be placed into gl_Color and gl_SecondaryColor in the Pixel shader depending on if the primitive's front face or back face is facing the camera. When this is disabled the values placed into gl_FrontColor and gl_FrontSecondaryColor are passed to gl_Color and gl_SecondaryColor regardless of which side of the primitive is facing the camera.

## Parameters - Attributes Page
- Attribute `attr` - A sequence of attributes that should be made accesible in the shader. In the past these would be manually declared inside the shader, but to add support for POP based workflows, they need to be setup via these parameters instead. You can access the shaders using `TDAttrib_<attribName>()`.
- Name `attr0name` - The name to give the attribute.
- Type `attr0type` - ⊞ - The type, both vector size as well as if it's a float, double (d), integer (i), or unsigned integer (u).

## Parameters - Samplers Page
- Sampler `sampler` - Sequence of samplers for use in the shader
- Name `sampler0name` - This is the sampler name that the GLSL program will use to sample from this TOP. The samplers need to be declared at the same dimentions as the TOP (sampler2D for a 2D TOP, sampler3D for 3D TOP).
- TOP `sampler0top` - ⊞ - This is the TOP that will be referenced by the above sampler name above it.
**Exposed by the + Button, texture sampling parameters** :
Refer to the [Texture Sampling Parameters](https://docs.derivative.ca/Texture_Sampling_Parameters "Texture Sampling Parameters") article for more information on the parameters exposed by pressing the + button. The _parameter_ prefix for each of the parameters is _top[digit]_.

- Name `vec0name` - The name of the vector.
- Value `vec0value` - ⊞ - The value to assign to the uniform. If the uniform is a float the first entry of the four is used, if the uniform is a vec2 the first two entries are used, etc.
  * Value `vec0valuex` -
  * Value `vec0valuey` -
  * Value `vec0valuez` -
  * Value `vec0valuew` -

## Parameters - Arrays Page
CHOP Uniforms allow you to send CHOP channel data into a GLSL shader as an array. Depending on the array type used, the number of values you can send into the shader may be limited. If you are using Uniform Arrays, you can use the Built-In variable $SYS_GFX_GLSL_MAX_UNIFORMS to get an idea of how many values you can pass to the shader. Current GPUs are vec4 based for uniform arrays, so the maximum array size is $SYS_GFX_GLSL_MAX_UNIFORMS / 4. Other uniforms will take away from this maximum. If you are using Texture Buffers the maximum array size is far bigger, $SYS_GFX_MAX_TEXTURE_BUFFER_SIZE will tell you the max for this. The max for texture buffer is per texture buffer, and having multiple texture buffers does not take away from the max for each array.
- Name `array` - Sequence of arrays to be used as uniforms
- Array `array` - Sequence of arrays to be used as uniforms

## Parameters - Matrices Page
Relative Xforms are matrices that will transform points and vectors from one space to another space.
- Matrix `matrix` - Sequence of matrices to be used as uniforms
- Name `matrix0name` - The name of the uniform. The uniform should be declared as a mat4.
- Matrix `matrix0value` - The value to assign the matrix. For valid ways to specify this, see the [Matrix Parameters](https://docs.derivative.ca/Matrix_Parameters "Matrix Parameters") article.
- Relative `rel` - A sequence of relative transforms. The transform is the relative transform one Object COMP to another.
- Name `rel0name` - The name of the uniform. The uniform should be declared as a mat4.

- Name `const0name` - The constant name, as declared in the shader.
- Value `const0value` - The value to give the constant.

## Parameters - Deform Page
Refer to the [ Deform Article](https://docs.derivative.ca/Deforming_Geometry_\(Skinning\) "Deforming Geometry \(Skinning\)") for more information on doing deforms in TouchDesigner.

###
Depth Test
Depth-Testing is comparing the depth value of the pixel being drawn with the pixel currently in the [Frame-Buffer](https://docs.derivative.ca/index.php?title=Frame-Buffer&action=edit&redlink=1 "Frame-Buffer \(page does not exist\)"). A pixel that is determined to be in-front of the pixel currently in the Frame-Buffer will be drawn over it. Pixels that are determined to be behind the pixel currently in the Frame-Buffer will not be drawn. Depth-Testing allows geometry in a 3D scene to occlude geometry behind it, and be occluded by geometry in-front of it regardless of the order the geometry was drawn.
For a more detailed description of Depth-Testing, refer to the [Depth-Test](https://docs.derivative.ca/Depth-Test "Depth-Test") article.

- Write Depth Values `depthwriting` - If Write Depth Values is on, pixels that pass the depth-test will write their depth value to the Depth-Buffer. If this isn't on then no changes will be made to the Depth-Buffer, regardless of if the pixels drawn pass or fail the depth-test.
- Discard Pixels Based on Alpha `alphatest` - This enables or disables the pixel alpha test.
- Keep Pixels with Alpha `alphafunc` - ⊞ - This menu works in conjunction with the Alpha Threshold parameter below in determining which pixels to keep based on their alpha value.
  * Less Than `less` -
  * Less Than or Equal `lessorequal` -
  * Greater Than `greater` -
  * Greater Than or Equal `greaterorequal` -

- Alpha Threshold `alphathreshold` - This value is what the pixel's alpha is compared to to determine if the pixel should be drawn. Pixels with alpha greater than the Alpha Threshold will be drawn. Pixels with alpha less than or equal to the Alpha Threshold will not be drawn.
- Wire Frame `wireframe` - ⊞ - Enables and disables wire-frame rendering with the option of OpenGL Tesselated or Topology based wireframes.
  * Off `off` -
  * OpenGL Tesselated Wire Frame `tesselated` -
  * Topology Wire Frame `topology` -

###
Alpha Test
Alpha-testing allows you to choose to draw or not draw a pixel based on its alpha value.

- Line Width `wirewidth` - This value is the width that the wires will be. This value is in pixels.
- Cull Face `cullface` - ⊞ - Selects which faces to render.
  * Use Render Setting `userender` - Use the render settings found in the Render or Render Pass TOP.
  * Neither `neither` - Do not cull any faces, render everything.
  * Back Faces `backfaces` - Cull back faces, render front faces.
  * Front Faces `frontfaces` - Cull front faces, render back faces.
  * Both Faces `bothfaces` - Cull both faces, render nothing.

- Polygon Depth Offset `polygonoffset` - Turns on the polygon offset feature.
- Offset Factor `polygonoffsetfactor` -
- Offset Units `polygonoffsetunits` -
###
Wire Frame
The wire-frame feature will render the geometry as wire-frame, using the actual primitive type used in the render. What this means is surfaces like Metaballs, NURBs and Beziers will become a wire-frame of the triangles/triangle-strips used to render them (since these types of primitives can't be natively rendered in OpenGL).

###
Cull Face
The cull face parameter will cull faces from the render output. This can be used as an optimization or sometimes to remove artifacts. See [Back-Face Culling](https://docs.derivative.ca/Back-Face_Culling "Back-Face Culling") for more infomation.

###
Polygon Depth Offset
This feature pushes the polygons back into space a tiny fraction. This is useful when you are rendering two polygons directly on-top of each other and are experiencing [Z-Fighting](https://docs.derivative.ca/Z-Fighting "Z-Fighting"). Refer to [Polygon Depth Offset](https://docs.derivative.ca/Polygon_Depth_Offset "Polygon Depth Offset") for more information. This is also an important feature when doing [shadows](https://docs.derivative.ca/Shadows "Shadows").

- Parameter Color Space `parmcolorspace` - ⊞ - Controls how all color parameters on this node are interpreted. The color values as treated as being in the selected color space, and are converted to the Working [Color Space](https://docs.derivative.ca/Color_Space "Color Space") before they are used as part of the node's operation. Note that this does not change the color space of the node itself, as that is always in the Working Color Space.
  * sRGB `srgb` - [sRGB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SRGB) color space, with sRGB transfer function. Considered an SDR color space with respect to Reference White.
  * sRGB - Linear `srgblinear` - [sRGB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SRGB) color space, with linear transfer function. Considered an SDR color space with respect to Reference White.

If they are different, then the Reference White level (brightness) of this color will be adjusted to the range expected by the Working Color Space. For example if the project is set to have a SDR Reference White of 120 nits, and the HDR Reference White is 80 nits, then a color of (1, 1, 1), which is 120 nits in the SDR color space, will be converted to be (1.5, 1.5, 1.5), which is 120 nits still in the HDR Working Color Space.
  * Default For Color Space `default` - Will use either the SDR or the HDR Reference White, based on the color space selected.
