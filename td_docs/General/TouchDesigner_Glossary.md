##  Learn to Speak the Language of TouchDesigner
**[.toe](https://docs.derivative.ca/.toe ".toe")** : TOuch Environment file, the file type used by TouchDesigner to save your entire project.
**[.tox](https://docs.derivative.ca/.tox ".tox")** : TouchDesigner Component file, the file type used to save a [Component](https://docs.derivative.ca/Component "Component") of your TouchDesigner project.
**[Absolute Time](https://docs.derivative.ca/Absolute_Time "Absolute Time")** or **[absTime](https://docs.derivative.ca/Absolute_Time "Absolute Time")** : Absolute Time starts counting from 0 when the TouchDesigner process starts, and is always increasing. It will pause if the Power 0/1 button at the top of the UI is Off or the root timeline is paused.
**[Adaptive Homing](https://docs.derivative.ca/Viewer "Viewer")** : In the [Node Viewer](https://docs.derivative.ca/Node_Viewer "Node Viewer") of a Geometry COMP or any POP, the Adaptive Homing option will continually keep in-view the 3D geometry being displayed, even when the geometry changes shape, size and animated position.
**[Annotate](https://docs.derivative.ca/Annotate_COMP "Annotate COMP")** or **[Annotation](https://docs.derivative.ca/Annotate_COMP "Annotate COMP")** : Annotates are displayed in the Network Editor as colored rectangles containing user-authored text and graphics. It is based on the [Annotate COMP](https://docs.derivative.ca/Annotate_COMP "Annotate COMP") and allows you to document your networks with useful information like comments and node grouping.
**[Attributes](https://docs.derivative.ca/Attribute "Attribute")** : Attributes are data associated with [POP](https://docs.derivative.ca/POP "POP") geometry. [Points](https://docs.derivative.ca/Point "Point"), [Vertex (Vertices)](https://docs.derivative.ca/Vertex "Vertex") and [Primitives](https://docs.derivative.ca/Primitive "Primitive") (polygons, lines, etc) can have any number of attributes. In POPs, position (`P`) is standard, and built-in optional attributes are [normals](https://docs.derivative.ca/Normals "Normals") (`N`), texture coordinates (`Tex`), color (`Color`), etc.
**[Backdrop](https://docs.derivative.ca/Backdrop "Backdrop")** : The Backdrop is the grid of node viewers that are visible behind the [Network](https://docs.derivative.ca/Network "Network"), set by turning on [Display Flags](https://docs.derivative.ca/Display_Flag "Display Flag") and the network RMB -> Display... Backdrop OPs.
**[Binding](https://docs.derivative.ca/Binding "Binding")** : Binding is a [Parameter Mode](https://docs.derivative.ca/Parameter_Mode "Parameter Mode") that ties two or more parameters' values together, where changing the value of any one of the bound parameters changes all of them. The actual value is stored in one place.
**[Bookmarks](https://docs.derivative.ca/Bookmark "Bookmark")** : A pull-down list at the top of a network [Pane](https://docs.derivative.ca/Pane "Pane") containing jump-to [Network Paths](https://docs.derivative.ca/Network_Path "Network Path").
**[Bypass](https://docs.derivative.ca/Bypass_Flag "Bypass Flag")** or **[Bypass Flag](https://docs.derivative.ca/Bypass_Flag "Bypass Flag")** : An operator whose Bypass flag is set does nothing: All data going into its first input appears at its output unaffected.
**[Callback](https://docs.derivative.ca/Callback "Callback")** : Some operators have a DAT [docked](https://docs.derivative.ca/Docking "Docking") to them that contains some python functions. These functions, called "callbacks", get called when something in the operator changes.
**[Channel](https://docs.derivative.ca/Channel "Channel")** : A [CHOP](https://docs.derivative.ca/CHOP "CHOP") outputs one or more channels, where a channel is simply a sequence of numbers ([Samples](https://docs.derivative.ca/Sample "Sample")), representing motion, audio, etc. Channels are passed between CHOPs in TouchDesigner networks. Channels can be [Exported](https://docs.derivative.ca/Export "Export") to [Parameters](https://docs.derivative.ca/Parameter "Parameter").
**[CHOP](https://docs.derivative.ca/CHOP "CHOP")** or **[Channel Operator](https://docs.derivative.ca/CHOP "CHOP")** : An [Operator Family](https://docs.derivative.ca/Operator_Family "Operator Family") which operate on [Channels](https://docs.derivative.ca/Channel "Channel") (a sequence of numbers ([Samples](https://docs.derivative.ca/Sample "Sample"))) which are used for animation, audio, mathematics, simulation, logic, UI construction, and data streamed from/to devices and protocols.
**[Clone](https://docs.derivative.ca/Clone "Clone")** : Cloning makes multiple components match the contents of a master component. A [Component](https://docs.derivative.ca/Component "Component") whose Clone parameter is set will be forced to contain the same nodes, wiring and parameters as its master component. Cloning does not create new components as does the [Replicator COMP](https://docs.derivative.ca/Replicator_COMP "Replicator COMP").
**[Component](https://docs.derivative.ca/Component "Component")** or **[COMP](https://docs.derivative.ca/Component "Component")** : An [Operator Family](https://docs.derivative.ca/Operator_Family "Operator Family") that contains its own [Network](https://docs.derivative.ca/Network "Network"). There are sixteen 3D [Object Component](https://docs.derivative.ca/Object_Component "Object Component") and ten 2D [Panel Component](https://docs.derivative.ca/Panel_Component "Panel Component") types.

**[Connector](https://docs.derivative.ca/Connector "Connector")** : The notches on the left and right of each [Node](https://docs.derivative.ca/Node "Node") that let you [Wire](https://docs.derivative.ca/Wire "Wire") the output of one [Operator](https://docs.derivative.ca/Operator "Operator") to the input of another of the same [Operator Family](https://docs.derivative.ca/Operator "Operator"). The notches on the top and bottom of [3D Object Components](https://docs.derivative.ca/Object "Object") and [Panel Components](https://docs.derivative.ca/Panel_Component "Panel Component") that tie the components of each sub-[Family](https://docs.derivative.ca/Operator_Family "Operator Family") in a [Hierarchy](https://docs.derivative.ca/Hierarchy "Hierarchy").
**[Container](https://docs.derivative.ca/Container_COMP "Container COMP")** : The Container component type is a [Panel Component](https://docs.derivative.ca/Panel_Component "Panel Component") that holds, lays out and displays any number of other Panel Components.
**[Cook](https://docs.derivative.ca/Cook "Cook")** : To re-compute the output data of the [Operators](https://docs.derivative.ca/Operator "Operator"). An operator cooks when (1) its inputs change, (2) its [Parameters](https://docs.derivative.ca/Parameter "Parameter") change, (3) when the timeline moves forward in some cases, or (4) [Scripting](https://docs.derivative.ca/Script "Script") commands are run on the node. When the operator is a [Panel Component](https://docs.derivative.ca/Panel_Component "Panel Component"), it also cooks when a user interacts with it. When an operator cooks, it usually causes operators connected to its output to re-cook. When TouchDesigner draws the screen, it re-cooks all the [Dependencies](https://docs.derivative.ca/Dependency "Dependency") - the necessary operators in all [Networks](https://docs.derivative.ca/Network "Network"), contributing to a frame's total "cook time".
**[DAT](https://docs.derivative.ca/DAT "DAT")** or **[Data Operator](https://docs.derivative.ca/DAT "DAT")** : An [Operator Family](https://docs.derivative.ca/Operator_Family "Operator Family") that manipulates text strings: multi-line text or tables. Multi-line text is often a python [Script](https://docs.derivative.ca/Script "Script") or [GLSL](https://docs.derivative.ca/GLSL "GLSL") Shader, but can be any multi-line text. [Tables](https://docs.derivative.ca/Table_DAT "Table DAT") are rows and columns of cells, each containing a text string.
**[Dependency](https://docs.derivative.ca/Dependency "Dependency")** : is the [Procedural](https://docs.derivative.ca/Procedural "Procedural") mechanism in TouchDesigner, where if one piece of data changes, it automatically causes other operators and expressions to re-[Cook](https://docs.derivative.ca/Cook "Cook").

**[Display Flag](https://docs.derivative.ca/Display_Flag "Display Flag")** : The blue [flag](https://docs.derivative.ca/Flag "Flag") on Geometry components and SOP operators determines if the geometry contained in that operator is visible in node viewers and geometry viewer panes. See [Render Flag](https://docs.derivative.ca/Render_Flag "Render Flag").
**[Docking](https://docs.derivative.ca/Docking "Docking")** or **[Docked](https://docs.derivative.ca/Docking "Docking")** : Any [node](https://docs.derivative.ca/Node "Node") can be docked to another node. This helps organize networks as two node that are docked together will stay together when the dock parent is moved in a network editor. A docked node can be collapsed into a small icon under the dock parent, reducing network clutter.
**[Event](https://docs.derivative.ca/Event "Event")** : Events are single-moment occurrences that are generated from a variety of conditions - from input actions that a user causes, from external devices and software, and from internal TouchDesigner states. A wide set of operator types respond to events and give the user a place to write python code that reacts to events.
**[Export](https://docs.derivative.ca/Export "Export")** : Exporting is the connection of CHOP channels to parameters of operators. The output of each exporting CHOP is one or more channels, active only while the [CHOP Viewer](https://docs.derivative.ca/CHOP_Viewer "CHOP Viewer") is on. The current value of a channel can be exported to a parameter of any operator, overriding that parameter's value. See [Parameter](https://docs.derivative.ca/Parameter "Parameter").
**[Expression](https://docs.derivative.ca/Expression "Expression")** : A text string that contains data (string, float, list, boolean, etc.) and operators (+ * < etc) that are evaluated by the node's language (python or Tscript) and returns a string, float list or boolean, etc. Expressions are used in parameters, [DATs](https://docs.derivative.ca/DAT "DAT") and in scripts.
**[Extend Conditions](https://docs.derivative.ca/Extend_Conditions "Extend Conditions")** or **[Extend Region](https://docs.derivative.ca/Extend_Conditions "Extend Conditions")** : In CHOPs, Extend Conditions determine what numbers you get when you try to get a channel value that is outside its start-end range - in its Extend Regions.

**[Filter per Sample](https://docs.derivative.ca/Filter_per_Sample "Filter per Sample")** : A powerful feature of CHOPs that filter over time, like the [Lag CHOP](https://docs.derivative.ca/Lag_CHOP "Lag CHOP") and [Filter CHOP](https://docs.derivative.ca/Filter_CHOP "Filter CHOP") where each sample acts as its own filter.
**[Flag](https://docs.derivative.ca/Flag "Flag")** : Indicator of certain states of an operator (bypass, display, lock, viewer active).
**[Folder](https://docs.derivative.ca/Folder "Folder")** : A Folder in TouchDesigner always refers to a Windows or macOS operating system directory/folder system that contain files and other folders. It does not refer to operators within TouchDesigner. See [Network Path](https://docs.derivative.ca/Network_Path "Network Path").
**[Frame](https://docs.derivative.ca/Frame "Frame")** : The term "Frame" is a measurement of time used (1) in the [Timeline](https://docs.derivative.ca/Timeline "Timeline"), (2) as a time-unit in CHOPs, and (3) as a time unit in movie files that are read into [TOPs](https://docs.derivative.ca/TOP "TOP") and written out from TOPs. The frame rate is the frames per second ([FPS](https://docs.derivative.ca/index.php?title=FPS&action=edit&redlink=1 "FPS \(page does not exist\)")).

**[Group](https://docs.derivative.ca/Group "Group")** : A Group in POPs and SOPs is a named subset of points or primitives. It is created with the [Group POP](https://docs.derivative.ca/Group_POP "Group POP") or Group SOP. Numerous operations in POPs and SOPs (using a Group parameter) can be restricted to affect the points or primitives in selected groups, and not affect others.
**[Hierarchy](https://docs.derivative.ca/Hierarchy "Hierarchy")** : Hierarchy relates components with other components. There are two groups of Hierarchy in TouchDesigner. 3D Object Components, and 2D Panel Components. Hierarchies let one component to be positioned relative to another. Each group can be connected via lines between the bottoms/tops of nodes in a network, or by placing one component inside the other.
**[Immune](https://docs.derivative.ca/Immune "Immune")** : Every node has an [Immune Flag](https://docs.derivative.ca/Immune_Flag "Immune Flag"), when on and the node is inside a [Clone](https://docs.derivative.ca/Clone "Clone"), it is not affected by any change to the clone master, so you can store extra data in the clone or set a node to be ignored by the cloning process.
**[Instance](https://docs.derivative.ca/Instance "Instance")** : (1) A [Geometry Component](https://docs.derivative.ca/Geometry_COMP "Geometry COMP") can instance and render its SOP geometry many times: once for each sample in a CHOP, row of a DAT table, pixel in a TOP, or point of a SOP, (2) An instance is an OP that doesn't actually have its own data, but rather just refers to an OP (or has an input) whose data it uses. This includes Null OPs, Switch OPs and in some cases Select OPs.
**[Internal Operators](https://docs.derivative.ca/Internal_Operators "Internal Operators")** : Internal Operators (iOPs) provide a simple shortcut to a frequently-used operator, accessing from anywhere in that component.
**[Internal Parameters](https://docs.derivative.ca/Internal_Parameters "Internal Parameters")** : Internal Parameters (iPars) act like local variables in a component.

**[Keyframe](https://docs.derivative.ca/Keyframe "Keyframe")** : In the [Animation component](https://docs.derivative.ca/Animation_COMP "Animation COMP") each keyframe specifies a channel's value at a specific time (or frame). A keyframe holds a value, slopes and accelerations, and an interpolation type. A channel's keyframes are used to interpolate and determine the values of all the samples of the channel.
**[Layout](https://docs.derivative.ca/Layout "Layout")** : (1) The TouchDesigner window is made of a menu bar at the top, a [Timeline](https://docs.derivative.ca/Timeline "Timeline") at the bottom, plus one of a choice of Layouts in the middle. A Layout is made on one or more Panes, each Pane can contain a Network Editor, Viewer, Panel, etc. See [Pane](https://docs.derivative.ca/Pane "Pane") and [Bookmark](https://docs.derivative.ca/Bookmark "Bookmark").

The path `/` is called [Root](https://docs.derivative.ca/Root "Root"). This path is displayed at the top of every [Pane](https://docs.derivative.ca/Pane "Pane"), showing which Component's network you are currently in. To refer instead to a filesystem folder, directory, disk file or `http:` address, see [Folder](https://docs.derivative.ca/Folder "Folder").

Perform Mode is an optimized mode for live performance that only renders one specified [Window COMP](https://docs.derivative.ca/Window_COMP "Window COMP") which is one window that contains your video outputs and your (optional) control interface. In Perform Mode the network editing window is not open - you edit your networks in [Designer Mode](https://docs.derivative.ca/Designer_Mode "Designer Mode"). Alternate with F1 and Esc.
A way of moving data from one TouchDesigner process to another. Images are moved via Touch Out / In TOPs, channels are moved via Touch Out / In CHOPs and Pipe Out / In CHOPs. Data moves via TCP/IP or UDP.
Playbar is the former name for Timeline. See [Timeline](https://docs.derivative.ca/Timeline "Timeline").
The panel at the bottom of TouchDesigner, it controls the current global looping [Time](https://docs.derivative.ca/Time_COMP "Time COMP") your TouchDesigner project, or of just one component.
Each SOP has a list of Points. Each point has an XYZ 3D position value plus other optional attributes. Each polygon [Primitive](https://docs.derivative.ca/Primitive "Primitive") is defined by a vertex list, which is list of point numbers.
The Graphics Processing Unit. This is the high-speed, many-core processor of the graphics card/chip that takes geometry, images and data from the CPU and creates images and processed data.
Privacy of TouchDesigner Components (`.tox` files) or Projects (`.toe` files) is the protection of networks that enables them to be used but not be visible or editable.
TouchDesigner Component file, the file type used to save a [Component](https://docs.derivative.ca/Component "Component") of your TouchDesigner project.
TOuch Environment file, the file type used by TouchDesigner to save your entire project.
Procedural means the automatic generation of outputs based on live inputs and the current state of TouchDesigner. It is the chain-reaction mechanism of TouchDesigner, where if one piece of data changes, it automatically causes other "[dependent](https://docs.derivative.ca/Dependency "Dependency")" operators and expressions to re-[Cook](https://docs.derivative.ca/Cook "Cook") and re-generate the outputs.
Quad Reprojection renders pixel-perfect perspective-correct images for flat TVs and LED panels hung at any orientation.
The 3D data held in SOPs and passed for rendering by the [Geometry COMP](https://docs.derivative.ca/Geometry_COMP "Geometry COMP").
Rendering is the creation of a 3D image with the Render TOP. Rendering is also used more generally to include the compositing (with TOPs) to generate an output image.
The location of an operator within the TouchDesigner environment, for example, `/geo1/circle1`, a node called `circle1` in a component called `geo1`. The path `/` is called [Root](https://docs.derivative.ca/Root "Root"). This path is displayed at the top of every [Pane](https://docs.derivative.ca/Pane "Pane"), showing which Component's network you are currently in. To refer instead to a filesystem folder, directory, disk file or `http:` address, see [Folder](https://docs.derivative.ca/Folder "Folder").
Sequential Parameters are blocks of parameters (Sequential Blocks) that can be reproduced multiple times by a user to create multiple entities.
A sequence of vertices form a [Polygon](https://docs.derivative.ca/Polygon "Polygon") in a [SOP](https://docs.derivative.ca/SOP "SOP"). Each vertex is an integer index into the [Point List](https://docs.derivative.ca/Point_List "Point List"), and each [Point](https://docs.derivative.ca/Point "Point") holds an XYZ position and attributes like Normals and Texture Coordinates.
Storage is a python dictionary in each operator, where users can store and fetch extra data.
Synths is a legacy term for the artworks created by TouchDesigner. A Synth consists of the [.toe](https://docs.derivative.ca/.toe ".toe") file created by TouchDesigner and all the associates media files that are needed to run an artwork in [TouchPlayer](https://docs.derivative.ca/TouchPlayer "TouchPlayer") or, in [Perform Mode](https://docs.derivative.ca/Perform_Mode "Perform Mode"), [TouchDesigner](https://docs.derivative.ca/TouchDesigner "TouchDesigner").
A Time Slice is the time from the last cook frame to the current cook frame. In CHOPs it is the set of short channels that contain the CHOP channels' samples between the last and the current cook frame.
Unicode text is fully supported in TouchDesigner. Unicode can be typed into parameters, DATs, Python scripts etc. Unicode encoded text files can be loaded into DATs. File paths can include any unicode character that is legal for a file path.
Lets you embed files inside a `.tox[](https://docs.derivative.ca/.tox ".tox")` or `.toe[](https://docs.derivative.ca/.toe ".toe")` file. Operators like the Movie File In TOP that read regular files can also read the embedded VFS files using a `vfs:` syntax.
A state of a node where you can operate the contents of its viewer (the + at botton-right of any node), like operating the gadgets of a panel in a node viewer, or the 3D data in the viewer of a Geometry component. With Viewer Active off you can select, move and delete nodes by clicking/dragging on them, even if the viewer is visible.
Widgets is a diverse collection of components located in the Palette, designed for building user interfaces.
A built-in panel in TouchDesigner that contains a library of components and media that can be dragged-dropped into a TouchDesigner network.
A Window in TouchDesigner is a window in Microsoft Windows or macOS that contains either (1) the TouchDesigner editing interface that exists in [Designer Mode](https://docs.derivative.ca/Designer_Mode "Designer Mode"), or (2) a user-created [Panel](https://docs.derivative.ca/Panel "Panel") inside a [Window Component](https://docs.derivative.ca/Window_COMP "Window COMP"). The user-created windows can span [Multiple Monitors](https://docs.derivative.ca/Multiple_Monitors "Multiple Monitors") borderless, or be floating windows with borders, or popups.
TouchDesigner is WYSIWID - What You See Is What It's Doing. All nodes can have interactive viewers of their data.
Sequential Parameters are blocks of parameters (Sequential Blocks) that can be reproduced multiple times by a user to create multiple entities.
