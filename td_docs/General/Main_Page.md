###  Release Notes
_Official Builds_ are production-ready, tested, and stable builds meant for building and delivering projects.
We are continually updating and improving Official Builds of TouchDesigner since its release in December 2023. Head to the [Release Notes](https://docs.derivative.ca/Release_Notes "Release Notes") for a full changelog and details on the currently-posted build. Check back often as we typically post a new build every other month and there are frequently new features added that don't make it into the original Official builds.

_Experimental Builds_ are for beta testing new features and concepts in TouchDesigner. Bug and stability issues may be encountered. We do not recommend using these builds for production work. For the latest in the Experimental builds, see [Experimental Release Notes](https://docs.derivative.ca/Release_Notes/Experimental "Release Notes/Experimental").
