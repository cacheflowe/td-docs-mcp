# Topology POP
## Summary

The Topology POP gives finer control on how to combine existing points and topology (vertices and primitives), as well as their memory allocation.
Any unsigned int attribute from the input POP or another POP, interpreted as a list of point indices, can be used to describe the topology of the POP, alongside a manual description of the number of primitives (Topology Info), either using the parameters when the number of primitives of each type are known on the CPU, or using values coming from attributes, when the number of primitives of each type are only known on the GPU. This allows to combine multiple buffers created with GLSL and GLSL Advanced POP to describe geometry for example.
Alternatively the Topology and Topology info can be provided from another POP. Primitives and Vertices attributes can also be merged in from other POPs.
Last but not least, for POPs whose numbers of points and primitives are known on the GPU, the maximum numbers can be updated here, if the user knows them to be smaller, to reduce the memory allocation of downstream POPs. Alternatively if the exact counts are known they can also be entered manually and the POP updated to know that its point count info and topology info are now known on the CPU, without incurring the cost and stall of a download. (Refer to Learning about POPs, Information known on CPU/GPU)
