# Line Thick POP
## Summary

The Line Thick POP is the engine that generates polygons for the [Line MAT](https://docs.derivative.ca/Line_MAT "Line MAT") before it's rendered. We're not sure how useful it is yet, but Vincent Houze thought we'd make a POP of it and see what happens. It takes line strips or points plus a [Camera COMP](https://docs.derivative.ca/Camera_COMP "Camera COMP") and generates triangles for the camera-facing distance-dependent thickened, colored lines, the rounded corners at each junction, the optional circles at each point, and vectors that you can create in the Line MAT.

- Delete Input Attributes `delinputattrs` - Only output which attributes you specify in this POP - helps isolate attributes into a separate branch.

The color values as treated as being in the selected color space, and are converted to the Working [Color Space](https://docs.derivative.ca/Color_Space "Color Space") before they are used as part of the node's operation. Note that this does not change the color space of the node itself, as that is always in the Working Color Space.
  * sRGB `srgb` - [sRGB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SRGB) color space, with sRGB transfer function. Considered an SDR color space with respect to Reference White.
  * sRGB - Linear `srgblinear` - [sRGB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SRGB) color space, with linear transfer function. Considered an SDR color space with respect to Reference White.

If they are different, then the Reference White level (brightness) of this color will be adjusted to the range expected by the Working Color Space. For example if the project is set to have a SDR Reference White of 120 nits, and the HDR Reference White is 80 nits, then a color of (1, 1, 1), which is 120 nits in the SDR color space, will be converted to be (1.5, 1.5, 1.5), which is 120 nits still in the HDR Working Color Space.
  * Default For Color Space `default` - Will use either the SDR or the HDR Reference White, based on the color space selected.
