# Group POP
## Summary

The Group POP lets you put sets of points or primitives into named groups so that you can then use the groups in other POPs, such as the [Transform POP](https://docs.derivative.ca/Transform_POP "Transform POP") to affect only the elements of particular groups.
The groups are formed using 5 methods found on the Attribute, Thin, Pattern, Group and Bounding pages. You can choose to group points or primitives. On the Attribute page you can group based on the values of point or primitive attributes. On the Thin page you can group based on parameter-defined ranges, steps or randomly. You can group by [Pattern Matching](https://docs.derivative.ca/Pattern_Matching "Pattern Matching") on the Pattern page. You can combine point or primitive groups on the Group page. You can include based on bounding ranges on any attribute on the Bounding page.
Conversions of groups can be done on the Edit page- renaming, conversion from point group to primitive group, etc.
Four of the grouping methods let you build the logic using sequential blocks of parameters. For example on the Attribute page, one block selects `P(0) > 0` and another that selects `P(1) < 0` and ANDed together they will group points in only a quarter of the space. Otherwise is common to build an attribute in a [Math Mix POP](https://docs.derivative.ca/Math_Mix_POP "Math Mix POP") and use it in the Group POP.
For pattern matching on the Pattern page: [Pattern Matching](https://docs.derivative.ca/Pattern_Matching "Pattern Matching").

Note that this does not change the color space of the node itself, as that is always in the Working Color Space.

  * sRGB - Linear `srgblinear` - [sRGB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SRGB) color space, with linear transfer function. Considered an SDR color space with respect to Reference White.

  * Passthrough `passthrough` - When selected, the color values will be used as-is in the operation, without any modification or attempt to convert them into the Working Color Space.

- Parameter Reference White `parmreferencewhite` - ⊞ - When converting a parameter color value to the Working Color Space, this controls how it should be treated with respect to [Reference White](https://docs.derivative.ca/Color_Space#Reference_White "Color Space"). If the Working Color Space is the same Reference White, then no adjustment is done. If they are different, then the Reference White level (brightness) of this color will be adjusted to the range expected by the Working Color Space. For example if the project is set to have a SDR Reference White of 120 nits, and the HDR Reference White is 80 nits, then a color of (1, 1, 1), which is 120 nits in the SDR color space, will be converted to be (1.5, 1.5, 1.5), which is 120 nits still in the HDR Working Color Space.
  * Default For Color Space `default` - Will use either the SDR or the HDR Reference White, based on the color space selected.
  * Use Parent Panel `useparent` - Will use the Reference White that the parent panel has selected. If the top-level panel also has 'Use Parent' selected, then 'UI Reference White' will be used.
  * Standard (SDR) `sdr` - Will treat the Parameter Color Space as SDR for it's reference white value.
  * High (HDR) `hdr` - Will treat the Parameter Color Space as HDR for it's reference white value.
  * UI `ui` - Will treat the Parameter Color Space as UI for it's reference white value. This uses the 'UI Reference White Nits' value for it's brightness.
