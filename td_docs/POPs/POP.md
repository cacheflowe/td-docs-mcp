# POP

## Summary

POPs (**Point Operators**) is a new [Operator Family](https://docs.derivative.ca/Operator_Family "Operator Family") of TouchDesigner that runs on the GPU accelerated graphics card or chips, and creates/modifies 3D data which is rendered by the Render TOP or passed to devices like DMX lighting, LED arrays, lasers or other external systems.
**The primary introductory documentation** for POPs and the POPs Example files are here: [Learning About POPs](https://www.notion.so/touchdesigner/Learning-About-POPs-3f7645a368a043f99cd143e2382b8ab0?source=copy_link)
Run Help -> OP Snippets in TouchDesigner to see examples per-POP type.

Each SOP has a list of Points. Each point has an XYZ 3D position value plus other optional attributes. Each polygon [Primitive](https://docs.derivative.ca/Primitive "Primitive") is defined by a vertex list, which is list of point numbers.
The Graphics Processing Unit. This is the high-speed, many-core processor of the graphics card/chip that takes geometry, images and data from the CPU and creates images and processed data.
An [Operator Family](https://docs.derivative.ca/Operator_Family "Operator Family") that creates, composites and modifies images, and reads/writes images and movies to/from files and the network. TOPs run on the graphics card's GPU.

[OP Snippets](https://docs.derivative.ca/OP_Snippets "OP Snippets") is a set of 700+ live examples of TouchDesigner operators. You can access snippets via the Help menu, or by right-clicking on network operators, or r-clicking on OP Create dialog items.
