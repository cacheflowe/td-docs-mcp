# POP Class
A POP describes a reference to a POP operator, containing points and primitives.


## Members
`compare` → `bool` :
Get or set Compare Flag.

`dimension` → `Dimension` **(Read Only)** :
The dimension in this POP.

`maxVertsPerLineStrip` → `int` **(Read Only)** :
The max number of verts per line strip in this POP.
`pointAttributes` → **(Read Only)** :
The set of point attributes defined in this POP.
`pointAttributesChanged` → **(Read Only)** :
The point attributes changed by this POP.
`primAttributes` → **(Read Only)** :
The set of primitive attributes defined in this POP.
`primAttributesChanged` → **(Read Only)** :
The prim attributes changed by this POP.

`template` → `bool` :
Get or set Template Flag.
`vertAttributes` → **(Read Only)** :
The set of vertex attributes defined in this POP.
`vertAttributesChanged` → **(Read Only)** :
The vert attributes changed by this POP.
## Methods
`bounds(delayed=False)`→ `Bounds`:
Returns an [object](https://docs.derivative.ca/Bounds_Class "Bounds Class") with the bounds, center and size of the POP's geometry.
  * delayed - (Keyword, Optional) If set to True, the download results will be delayed until the next call to bounds(), avoiding stalling the GPU waiting for the result immediately.

`computeBounds(display=False, render=False, delayed=False)`→ `Bounds`:
Returns an [object](https://docs.derivative.ca/Bounds_Class "Bounds Class") with the bounds, center and size of the POP's geometry.
  * display - (Keyword, Optional) If set to True, only calculate Bounding Box if POP display flag is set.
  * render - (Keyword, Optional) If set to True, only calculate Bounding Box if POP render flag is set.
  * delayed - (Keyword, Optional) If set to True, the download results will be delayed until the next call to computeBounds(), avoiding stalling the GPU waiting for the result immediately.

`numPoints(delayed=False, max=False)`→ `int`:
Returns the number of points contained in this POP.
  * delayed - (Keyword, Optional) If set to True, the download results will be delayed until the next call to numPoints(), avoiding stalling the GPU waiting for the result immediately.
  * max - (Keyword, Optional) If set to True, returns the number of allocated points (max number of points). In that case result is always instant, delayed is disregarded.

`numPrims(delayed=False, max=False, primType=None)`→ `int`:
Returns the number of primitives contained in this POP.
  * delayed - (Keyword, Optional) If set to True, the download results will be delayed until the next call to numPrims(), avoiding stalling the GPU waiting for the result immediately.
  * max - (Keyword, Optional) If set to True, returns the number of allocated primitives (max number of primitives). In that case result is always instant, delayed is disregarded.
  * primType - (Keyword, Optional) If set to triangles, quads, lineStrips, lines or pointPrims, returns the number of primitives for that primitive type only.

`numVerts(delayed=False, max=False, lineStrips=False)`→ `int`:
Returns the number of vertices contained in this POP.
  * delayed - (Keyword, Optional) If set to True, the download results will be delayed until the next call to numVerts(), avoiding stalling the GPU waiting for the result immediately.
  * max - (Keyword, Optional) If set to True, returns the number of allocated vertices (max number of verts). In that case result is always instant, delayed is disregarded.
  * lineStrips - (Keyword, Optional) If set to true, returns the number of verts for line strips only.

`points(attributeName, startIndex=0, count=-1, delayed=False)`→ `list`:
Returns the point attribute values as a list.
  * attributeName - The attribute name.
  * startIndex - (Keyword, Optional )The point index to start at (default 0).
  * count - (Keyword, Optional) The number of points to download. A value of -1 fetches all elements from the start index onward.
  * delayed - (Keyword, Optional) If set to True, the download results will be delayed until the next call to vals(), avoiding stalling the GPU waiting for the result immediately.

`prims(attributeName, startIndex=0, count=-1, delayed=False)`→ `list`:
Returns the primitive attribute values as a list.
  * attributeName - The attribute name.
  * startIndex - (Keyword, Optional )The primitive index to start at (default 0).
  * count - (Keyword, Optional) The number of primitives to download. A value of -1 fetches all elements from the start index onward.
  * delayed - (Keyword, Optional) If set to True, the download results will be delayed until the next call to vals(), avoiding stalling the GPU waiting for the result immediately.

`reallocate()`→ `None`:
Forces the POP to reallocate its GPU buffers.

`save(filepath, createFolders=False)`→ `str`:
Save the POP geometry to file system. Multiple file types are supported. Returns the filename and path saved.
  * filepath - (Optional) The path and filename to save to. If not given then a default filename will be used, and the file will be saved in the project.folder folder.
  * createFolders - (Keyword, Optional) If True, it creates the not existent directories provided by the filepath.

`verts(attributeName, startIndex=0, count=-1, delayed=False)`→ `list`:
Returns the vertex attribute values as a list.
  * attributeName - The attribute name.
  * startIndex - (Keyword, Optional )The vertex index to start at (default 0).
  * count - (Keyword, Optional) The number of vertices to download. A value of -1 fetches all elements from the start index onward.
  * delayed - (Keyword, Optional) If set to True, the download results will be delayed until the next call to vals(), avoiding stalling the GPU waiting for the result immediately.

POPs (**Point Operators**) is a new [Operator Family](https://docs.derivative.ca/Operator_Family "Operator Family") of TouchDesigner that runs on the GPU accelerated graphics card or chips, and creates/modifies 3D data which is rendered by the [Render TOP](https://docs.derivative.ca/Render_TOP "Render TOP") or passed to devices like DMX lighting, LED arrays, lasers or other external systems.
Indicator of certain states of an operator (bypass, display, lock, viewer active).
Dimension is metadata of a POP that describes the structure of the point list, which may be made of rows and columns of points (which is two dimensions of size nrows and ncolumns).
The Graphics Processing Unit. This is the high-speed, many-core processor of the graphics card/chip that takes geometry, images and data from the CPU and creates images and processed data.
