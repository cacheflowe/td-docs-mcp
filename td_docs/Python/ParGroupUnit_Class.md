# ParGroupUnit Class
The ParGroupUnit class describes a subclass of a [ParGroup](https://docs.derivative.ca/ParGroup_Class "ParGroup Class") ending with a unit parameter. See also Custom ParGroup.
**Note:** the ParGroupUnit class will be deprecated in coming TouchDesigner releases. It is recommended that you access unit parameters directly rather than through this object.

## Members
`unit` → `Par` **(Read Only)** :
The unit parameter in this ParGroupUnit object.

`unitPar` → `Par` **(Read Only)** :
The unit parameter in this ParGroupUnit object.
## Methods
No operator specific methods.
A ParGroup is a group of related parameters that you can set and get as a whole instead of its individual parameters, like ParGroup `t` is `tx ty tz`.
