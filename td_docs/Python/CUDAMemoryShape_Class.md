# CUDAMemoryShape Class
Describes the shape of a CUDA memory segment.

## Members
`width` → `int` :
Get/Set the width in pixels of the memory.

`height` → `int` :
Get/Set the height in pixels of the memory.

`numComps` → `int` :
Get/Set the number of color components per pixel of the memory.

`depth` → `int` :
Get/Set the depth in pixels of the memory.

`isCube` → `bool` :
Get/Set whether this shape describes a cubemap. Depth must equal 6.

`is3D` → `bool` :
Get/Set whether this shape describes a 3D texture. If this is false and depth > 1, then it's a 2D array.

`dataType` → `numpy.dtype` :
Get/Set the data type of each color component, as a numpy data type. E.g numpy.uint8, numpy.float32. Note that for uint8 data types, the channel ordering will be BGRA for 4 component textures. It will be RGBA however for other data types.
## Methods
No operator specific methods.
