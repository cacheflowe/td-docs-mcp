# Vector Class
The vector class holds a single 3 component vector. A vector describes a direction in space, and it's important to use a vector or [Position](https://docs.derivative.ca/Position_Class "Position Class") as appropriate for the data that is being calculated. When being multiplied by a [Matrix](https://docs.derivative.ca/Matrix_Class "Matrix Class"), this class will implicitly have a 4th component (W component) of 0. A new vector can be created without any arguments, with 3 arguments for the x,y,z values, or with a single argument which is a variable that has 3 entries such as a list of length 3, or a position or vector.
**Note:** tdu.___ and TDU.___ can be used interchangeably. In general, TDU.___ is used to represent a class, while tdu.___ is used for the instantiator function.
Examples of creating a vector:

```
v = tdu.Vector() # starts as (0, 0, 0)
v2 = tdu.Vector(0, 0, -1)
values = [0, 1, 0]
v3 = tdu.Vector(values)

# vectors can be accessed like Python lists
print(v3[1])	# same as v3.y
v3[2] = 1		# same as v3.z

```

`TDU.Vector(*args)`→ `TDU.Vector`:
Create a new vector object. The following argument forms are valid instantiators:
  * `tdu.Vector()` - (0, 0, 0)
  * `tdu.Vector(vector : TDU.Vector)` - copy the vector
  * `tdu.Vector(position: TDU.Position)` - copy the position values
  * `tdu.Vector(x : float, y : float,  z : float)` - (x, y, z)
  * `tdu.Vector(f : float)` - (f, f, f)
  * `tdu.Vector(vec : list)` - 3 item list to fill vector

}}

  * vec - The other vector to use to calculate the cross product.

```
c = v.cross(otherV)

```

`project(vec1, vec2)`→ `None`:
Projects this vector onto the plan defined by vec1 and vec2. Both vec1 and vec2 must be normalized. The result may not be normalized.
  * vec1, vec2 - The vectors that specify the plane to project onto. Must be normalized.

```

### Special Functions
`TDU.Vector[i]`→ `float`:
Gets or sets the component of the vector specified by i, where i can be 0, 1, or 2.

```

```

`TDU.Vector * float`→ `TDU.Vector`:
Scales the vector by the give float scalar and returns a new vector as the result.

```
v = v * 2.0
v = 2.0 * v

```

`TDU.Vector + float`→ `TDU.Vector`:
Adds the given scalar to all 3 components of the vector and returns a new vector as the result.

```
v = v + 5.0
v = 5.0 + v

```

`TDU.Vector - float`→ `TDU.Vector`:
Subtracts the given scalar from all 3 components of the vector and returns a new vector as the result.

```
v = v - 1.5
v = 1.5 - v

```

`TDU.Vector + TDU.Vector`→ `TDU.Vector`:
Adds the two vectors to create a new vector.

```
v3 = v1 + v2

```

`TDU.Vector - TDU.Vector`→ `TDU.Vector`:

```
v3 = v1 - v2

```

`TDU.Vector += TDU.Vector`→ `TDU.Vector`:

```
v1 += v2

```

`TDU.Vector += float`→ `TDU.Vector`:
Adds the given scalar to all 3 components of the vector, the vector will contain the result of the operation.

```
v1 += 0.4

```

`TDU.Vector -= TDU.Vector`→ `TDU.Vector`:
Subtracts the 2nd vector from the 1st vector, the 1st vector will contain the result of the operation.

```
v1 -= v2

```

`tdu.Matrix * TDU.Vector`→ `TDU.Vector`:
Multiplies the vector by the matrix and returns the a new vector as the result. Since a Vector is direction only and has no notion of a position, the translate part of the matrix does not get applied to the vector.

```
v = M * v

```

`TDU.Vector / float`→ `TDU.Vector`:
Divides each component of the vector by the scalar and returns the a new vector as the result.

```
v = v / 0.2

```

`TDU.Vector *= tdu.Matrix`→ `TDU.Vector`:
Multiplies the vector by the matrix, the vector will contain the result. The vector is multiplied on the right of the matrix. This is the same as doing v = M * v, although more efficient since it doesn't require assigning a new vector to v. Since a Vector is direction only and has no notion of a position, the translate part of the matrix does not get applied to the vector.

```
v *= M

```

`TDU.Vector *= float`→ `TDU.Vector`:
Scales all 3 components of the vector by the given scalar. The vector will contain the result.

```
v *= 1.1
